956
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,347
    Relax, Hansen.              
    You're one of the good ones.

957
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,083
    Okay.                       
    Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.        

958
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,152
    Things have been            
    a little difficult.

00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:06,111
        I'm just saying         
        that perhaps you could  
        channel those energies, 

961
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:09,514
            um, into something  
            like this.          

962
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:15,353

964

            somebody's wife.    

1376
01:23:49,623 --> 01:23:51,706
Surprised me too.               

1377
01:23:51,774 --> 01:23:54,576
        I don't think I'll ever 
        understand that.        

1378
01:23:55,979 --> 01:23:58,646
        I mean,                 
        it doesn't make sense.

1380

        Right, but that's what  
        I don't understand.     
        What just happened?     

1381
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:10,525
    I just-- I just             
    woke up one day,            
    and I knew.                 

1382
01:24:10,594 --> 01:24:12,527
                    Knew what?  

1383
01:24:14,864 --> 01:24:17,365
What I was never sure of        
with you.

    you believe in is complete

            It sucks.           
What do you mean?               

1387
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:43,158

01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:50,298
                You were right. 
                I-I should have 
                listened to you.

1390
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:53,985
    No.

01:24:59,192 --> 01:25:01,960

    like that for?              

1393
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:04,663
Well, you know,                 

1394
01:25:04,731 --> 01:25:06,965
I guess it's 'cause...          

1395
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:09,601
I was sitting in a deli         
and reading<i> Dorian Gray,</i>        

1396
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:12,203
and... a guy                    
comes up to me...               

1397
01:25:12,272 --> 01:25:14,872
and asked me about it,          

1398
01:25:14,941 --> 01:25:17,942
and... now he's my husband.     

1399
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,248
                Yeah. And... so?

1400
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:27,218
So, what if I'd gone            
to the movies?                  

1401
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:32,223
What if I had gone              
somewhere else for lunch?       

1402
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:35,627
What if I'd gotten there        
10 minutes later?               

1403
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,196
        It was--                

1404
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:41,633
It was meant to be.             

1405
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,352
And I just kept thinking,

that you were right about.      

1410
