Well, your beauty's a problem.

  True, but this one            
   overcompensates              

635
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,830
         by wearing             
slightly masculine clothing,    

636
01:03:09,832 --> 01:03:12,366
   being more aggressive        
than her female colleagues,     

637
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:14,985
which gives her a somewhat...   
      prickly demeanor,         

638
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:16,336
and ironically enough,          

639
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:18,638
 makes it less likely           
for her to be accepted          

640
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,092
     and promoted               
by her male superiors,

       for arrogance.

649
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,753
             my guess is        
     you didn't come from money,

              Which means       
        you were at that school 

652
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:56,159

      of someone else's charity,

653
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:57,911
hence the chip on your shoulder.

654
01:03:57,913 --> 01:04:00,681
  And since your first thought  
    about me ran to orphan,     

655
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:02,633
  that's what I'd say you are.
