00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,894
 Mama made me play every day    
 in my childhood.               

247
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,796
 Didn't have any friends.       

248
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,900
  So now I never                
  play when I play. (LAUGHS)

It's too bad you're so big,     
you could try one of these on.  

254
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,776
 So, Scott,                     
 do you have any family left?   

255
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:30,344
 Oh, no, not really.            

256
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,513
             Um...              

257
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,649
       My mom's been in         
       and out of places,       

258
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,551
you know, her...my whole life.  

259
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:39,153
            Oh, really?         

260
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,389
   Um, and I have               
   two sisters, a brother,      

261
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:46,660
   and then four                
   half-brothers and sisters    
   from two different fathers,  

262
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:49,029
    but most of them            
    live with their fathers.    

263
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:53,433
   And the rest of us,          
   like me and Wayne, we were   
   sent to state-run homes,     

264
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:56,687
 and then Mom would come        
 get us and we'd live           
 with her for a while,          

265
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,790
 and then she'd have her        
 troubles again, and they'd     
 have to put her away,          

266
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,561
 and so, we'd get split up      
 and sent to foster homes.      

267
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,547
 But I was really lucky.        
 I ended up with Rose and Joe.  

268

 You know, a really nice        
 family, and on a ranch and,    
 you know, with animals.        

269
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,272
 Sure, because it was a ranch!  

270
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,973
         Oh, what a story!      

271

       everything but a fire    
       in the orphanage, yeah.  

272
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,914
But the ranch is where          
you got to like animals and...  

273
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,700
         I guess. Um...         

274
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,136
      Oh, and I am gonna        
      try and get that          
      medicine for Baby Boy.    

275
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:34,041

  Oh, that would be wonderful.

 house yesterday...

 ...has medicine.

00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,323
 Yeah, I have the medicine for  
 your poodle, for his eyes.

    just, um, tuck it in        
    the mail tomorrow morning,  

299

 to have to wait that long.

      It's not that important.  

304
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,483
 Scott, why don't you let me    
 decide what's important?       

305
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:12,122
 You know, you'd be doing me

00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,873
   Thank you so much            
   for bringing my              
   baby's medicine.             

311

           He's gonna be fine.  

312
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,880
  What would you like           
  to do with your life,         
  Scott?                        

313
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,349
   What's your dream?           

314
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,084
  I want to be a veterinarian.  

315
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,254
  Oh, don't you just            
  love animals?                 

316
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,989
        So do I.                

317
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,926
   You know,                    
   because they love            
   you no matter what.          

318
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,997
   That's what makes            
   them dumb animals,           
   I guess.                     

319
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,485
 If they really knew who        
 we were, they'd have           
 nothing to do with us.         

320
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:06,793
   Scott, I feel like           
   I can trust you.             

321
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,798
 And I have to                  
 talk to someone.               

322
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,769
  I've got myself               
  in a terrible mess.           

323
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,656
                 What is it?    

324
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,426
 It's Billy. My protege.        

325
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:25,929
 I've created a monster.        
 A monster.                     

326
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,333
 I gave him everything,         
 you know? I put his names in   
 lights, I made him famous...   

327
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,067
               What did he do?  

328
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,971
 Well, he's outta control!      
 He's ruining me!               
 He's ruining my image!         

329
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,959
 I can't stand bad publicity!   
 My fans, you know?             

330
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:42,028
 Unfortunately,                 
 they're not dumb animals.      

331
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,249
 He's just...                   
 He's done terrible things!     
 He's breakin' my heart.        

332
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,119
 It's just                      
 he's drinkin' heavily,         
 he's getting into fights.      

333
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:53,323
 And I can't get rid of him!    
 He's under contract            
 for six months!                

334
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,125
  I'm gonna be ruined!          

335
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,178
 I just wish his wife would     
 come and take him away.        

336
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,631
                 His wife?      

337
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,134
 Hand me a towel, please.       

338
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:07,821
 Thank you.                     

339
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:16,130
You know, I never know whether  
people like me for me, or what  
they can get out of me.         

340
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,299
         You know,              
         because I'm Liberace.  

341
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,069
              Walter Liberace,  
              for God's sakes!  

342
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,071
      I mean, can you imagine?  

343
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:27,641
    I mean,                     
    Walter's fine for Pidgeon,  
    but Liberace?               

344
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,845
      It was the only           
      thing my father gave me.  

345
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,947
  He was a French horn player.  

346
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,932
 He left us for an oboist.      

347
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,571
 SCOTT: So that's why           
 you're so musical?             

348
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:45,342
     No, that man had           
     nothing to do with it.     
     My talent comes from God.  

349
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,613
Everybody wants a piece of me,  
a piece of the action.          

350
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,183
           My brother, George,  
           he performs in       
           some small club.     

351
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,321
    You know what               
    the marquee says?           
    "Liberace" in big letters.  

352
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:01,024
 I built that name.             
 It's my name. That's not his.  

353
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,996
 "Gimme, gimme, gimme."         

354
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,733
 No one I can trust,            
 no one I can talk to.          

355
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,569
 I hate my life sometimes,      
 I really do, and...            

356
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,572
                    Oh, no.     
 No, it's true.                 

357
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,476

01:13:38,764 --> 01:13:42,899
    I think our relationship    
    is in a really good place,  
    don't you?                  

1181
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:45,785
     Mmm-hmm.                   
                   I do.        

1182
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:51,758
  So I think it'd be a good     
  thing for us if we were able  
  to see other people, too.     

1183
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,626
 I don't mean like you and me.

01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:57,363

 nothing will ever be like us.  

1185

      I just know there are     
      things that I like to do  
      that you don't,           

1186
01:14:00,668 --> 01:14:04,087
      and things that you       
      like to do that I don't.  

1187
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:06,355
    And I just think that       
    we're in such a good place  

1188
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:10,426
 that we can allow each other,  
 you know, to do that           

1189

      other and stay together.

 if that's what you want.

     all of my personal         
     belongings with me.        

1529
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,629
   All of them, Seymour,        
   or I will fucking sue you!

1549

      Joel Strote has my copy.  

1557
01:37:13,343 --> 01:37:17,212
      Was there ever any

      prepared by Joel Strote?

01:37:19,683 --> 01:37:22,483
      Yes. The will. My will.   

1560
01:37:22,485 --> 01:37:25,053
        Did you ever            
        execute this will?      

1561
01:37:25,055 --> 01:37:26,454

1562
01:37:26,456 --> 01:37:30,491
 Did anyone witness             
 your executed will?            

1563
01:37:30,493 --> 01:37:35,530
     When you mean "executed,"  
     do you... I didn't         
     sign it yet. I mean...     

1564
01:37:35,532 --> 01:37:39,567
      He doesn't                
      understand "executed"     
      to mean signing.          

1565
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:42,170
 What did you mean              
 when you said "executed"?      

1566
01:37:42,172 --> 01:37:46,074
          Well, you mean,       
          did I ever sign it?   
          No, I never did. No.  

1567
01:37:46,076 --> 01:37:47,943
 Why didn't you ever sign it?   

1568
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:50,946
        Because Liberace and I  
        were having problems.   

1569
01:37:51,849 --> 01:37:54,783
 What kind of problems?         

1570
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:58,453
          I felt that he was    
          seeing other people.  

1571
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:02,124
        Did you ever receive    
        a copy of this will?    

1572
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:05,744
          SCOTT: Joel Strote    
          kept my copy for me.  

1573
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:09,948
  Was it your expectation that  
  you would become the legally  
  adopted son of Liberace?      

1574
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:11,717
              Yes.              

1575
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,886
  And continue in               
  a sexual relationship         
  with him after the adoption?  

1576
01:38:14,888 --> 01:38:16,120
               No.              

1577
01:38:16,122 --> 01:38:20,024
   Is that when you             
   thought the sex would stop?  

1578
01:38:20,026 --> 01:38:25,296
   Our relationship towards     
   later on went from           
   a sexual relationship to...  

1579
01:38:25,298 --> 01:38:28,500
     Lee always thought of      
     me as more of a son.       

1580
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:31,903
We had our sexual relationship  
in the beginning                
of our relationship,            

1581
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,438
  and it was, more or less...   

1582
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,973
    He thought of me as a...    

1583
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:38,276
       He wanted me to          
       think of him as          
       a father-type image.     

1584
01:38:39,062 --> 01:38:40,262
 He thought... (SIGHS)          

1585
01:38:40,264 --> 01:38:42,730
 This is...                     
 It's so hard to explain.       

1586
01:38:42,732 --> 01:38:47,985
LIBERACE: His duties were       
expanded to be a road manager,

  the fans, media,              

1588
01:38:54,044 --> 01:38:58,780
 answering the phone,           
 answering knocks on the door,  

1589
01:38:58,782 --> 01:39:04,719
uh, driving me from places      
of engagement where limousines  
were not provided for me.

1598
01:39:25,309 --> 01:39:27,509
       What reason do you       
       have for believing that  

1599
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:31,913
 the furniture and furnishings  
 you think of as gifts were,    
 in fact, not gifts?            

1600
01:39:31,915 --> 01:39:36,968
  Well, this is what I do with  
  all my homes. I furnish all   
  my homes for people to use.   

1601
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:41,539
   But that does not mean       
   they can take the furniture  
   with them when they leave.   

1602
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:43,524
             It's my property.

            to Scott Thorson?   

1604
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:47,628
                          Yes.  

1605
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,264
                    What furs?  

1606
01:39:49,266 --> 01:39:53,801
     Uh, a raccoon,             
     a black mink trench coat,  

1607
01:39:53,803 --> 01:39:57,172
a leather and black mink coat,  

1608

        other gifts have you

made up the ring.

Well, there's nothin' in here   
about the jewelry he gave you,  
so you get to keep that.

           Thank you.           

1753
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:33,110
           Thank you.           

1754
01:52:33,112 --> 01:52:38,849
   You have made me             
   the happiest piano player    
   who has ever lived.          

1755
01:52:38,851 --> 01:52:44,688
      And no matter what,       
      I still believe,          
      and always will,          

1756
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:49,826
      too much of a good        
      thing is wonderful!

1758
01:54:12,362 --> 01:54:14,595
  LIBERACE: <i> Why do I love you?</i> 

1759
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:21,802
  <i> I love you not only for what</i> 
  <i> you are, but for what I am</i>   
  <i> when I'm with you.</i>           

1760
01:54:21,804 --> 01:54:25,706
       <i> I love you not only</i>     
       <i> for what you have</i>       
       <i> made of yourself,</i>       

1761
01:54:26,842 --> 01:54:30,610
        <i> but for what you</i>       
        <i> are making of me.</i>      

1762
01:54:30,612 --> 01:54:35,949
    <i> I love you for ignoring</i>    
    <i> the possibilities</i>          
    <i> of the fool in me,</i>         

1763
01:54:37,686 --> 01:54:42,757
       <i> and for accepting</i>       
       <i> the possibilities</i>       
       <i> of the good in me.</i>      

1764
01:54:51,133 --> 01:54:54,101
       <i> Why do I love you?</i>      

1765
01:54:54,103 --> 01:55:00,508
      <i> I love you for</i>           
      <i> closing your eyes to</i>     
      <i> the discords in me,</i>      

1766
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:06,147
    <i> and for adding</i>             
    <i> to the music in me</i>         
    <i> by worshipful listening.</i>   

1767
01:55:08,684 --> 01:55:13,254
     <i> I love you</i>                
     <i> for helping me to</i>         
     <i> construct of my life,</i>     

1768
01:55:13,256 --> 01:55:16,157
  <i> not a tavern, but a temple.</i>  

1769
01:55:19,962 --> 01:55:25,566
     <i> I love you because</i>        
     <i> you have done so</i>          
     <i> much to make me happy.</i>    

1770
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:30,037
        <i> You have done it</i>       
        <i> without a word,</i>        

1771
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:33,607
        <i> without a touch,</i>       
        <i> without a sign.</i>        

1772
01:55:35,178 --> 01:55:39,713
      <i> You have done it by</i>      
      <i> just being yourself.</i>     

1773
01:55:40,749 --> 01:55:42,883
      <i> Perhaps, after all,</i>      

1774
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:47,588
    <i> that is what love means,</i>   

1775
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:50,524
        <i> and that is why</i>        

1776
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,059
            <i> I love you.</i>
