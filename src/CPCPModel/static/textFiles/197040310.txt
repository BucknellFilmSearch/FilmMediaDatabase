         Rob, this is Travis.   

768

    Hi.                         
             Hi. Oh, pleasure.

              I've heard        
              a lot about you.

00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:37,535
              Congratulations,  
              by the way.

 Enjoy, everybody.              
        It's good to meet you.

 Yeah, isn't that crazy?

871

 I mean, Rob's been in love     
 with her since college.        

872
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:37,637
       Well, maybe it was like
