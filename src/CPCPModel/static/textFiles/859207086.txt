your tutor's here.

342
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,453
Chris, your...

343
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,789
Holy shit.

344
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,424
My destiny.

345
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,637
Chris, just because
your mom liked to get
a little freaky now.

346
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,706
I know what my role
is in this, Javier.

347
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,107
My dad was a crime boss,
so it just makes sense.

Just put those things down
before you
hurt somebody, Chris.

351

That's not my name.

352
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,953
Okay, okay.
Uh, Red Mist...

353
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,852
Red Mist was
my superhero name.

354
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,586
Henceforth
I'll be known as

355
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:10,657

DAVE: After Mindy quit,

357
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,961
I decided to stop hitting
the heavy bag and start
hitting the streets.

358
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,229
Hey, Kick-Ass,
welcome back!

359
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,430

361
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:25,777
Only problem,
I was still on my own.

362
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,403
So I went online
and found
a physics professor

363
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,506
calling himself
"Dr. Gravity."

364
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,711
Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,
but I had to start somewhere.

365
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:36,311
This is the zero G device
that I invented.

This is a baseball
bat wrapped in tinfoil.

a physics professor.

372

for an ad agency.

But that's why
I love this stuff.

374
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,565
You can be
anyone you want!

375
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:57,065
You done many
team-ups before?

376
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,610
Kind of. Yeah.
No, not really.

377
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,804
I was getting kinda
nervous about being
on my own, you know?

378
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,873
Yeah, me, too.
I never even been
in a fight.

379
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,818
Well, hopefully
you won't have to.

380
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,321

about forming a team,

how serious he is,

but his picture
was pretty hard core.

That's why I contacted you.

00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:21,265

you out by bringing it
up too soon.

you that, forget it.

like us or talk like us,

508
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:33,335
but when it comes to boys,
we're all the same.

509
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:36,407
Twilight. Channing Tatum.
Union J.

510
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:39,807
It's biology, bitch.
Don't fight it.

511
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:43,572
I, um...

512
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,409
I gotta go.

513
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,918
But we were gonna go
and get high on bath salts
at Logan's house.

514
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,487
Mindy, I wanna
give you a chance

515
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,819
that the rest of the girls
in our class would kill for.

516
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,621
Don't you wanna walk
out the door every day
in skin-tight clothes

517
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,424
knowing that
everyone worships you?

518
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:02,762
Don't you wanna
sneak out at night,
raise a little hell,

519
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,563
and show the world
what a strong,

520
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:07,537
independent woman
is capable of?

521
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:09,804
Don't you wanna belong?

522
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:13,537
So you know that
I'll carry you

523
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:14,772
Can I wear this
to Logan's?

524
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:15,904
Yay!

525
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:17,515
HARLOW: It's gonna be
so much fun.

526
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,714
So we tried the cops
and tried the newspapers,

527
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:27,753
and even set up a, you know,
a thing on the Internet

528
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,555
for people to
help us find Tommy.

529
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,828
Um...

530
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:36,732
But we got nothing.
We never saw
our son again.

531
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,767
I came up with the name
Remembering Tommy,

532
00:27:40,906 --> 00:27:44,069
and, uh, we've been
doing this three nights
a week. So...

533
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:47,234
Colonel Stars and Stripes
found us online.

534
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,714
That's terrible, guys.
I'm real sorry.

535
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:54,410
I became Night Bitch
after my sister was murdered
and found in a dumpster.

536
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:55,679
Holy shit.

537
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:57,448
Doesn't bring her back,

538
00:27:57,522 --> 00:27:59,285
but at least
I'm doing something
positive about it.

539
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,692
Insect Man.
Yeah, um...

540
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:05,391
I've been bullied
my whole life
for being gay,

541
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,431
so now I stand up
for the defenseless.

542
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,762
That's why
I don't wear a mask.

543
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,326
Too much like being
back in the closet.

544
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,705
COLONEL: Long as your
heart's in the right place,

545
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:16,468
we don't care what you
put in your mouth.

546
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,634
Fist bump.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

547
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,905
Well, I became Battle Guy

548
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:24,642
after my parents were
mugged and killed coming
home from the opera.

549
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,240
Did I tell you
that sick bastard

550
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:28,047
maxed out their credit
cards on porno sites?

551
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:30,519
I hope we get the chance
to say hello to
this guy someday

552
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:33,251
so I can personally
levitate his soul
from his body.

553
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,019
Oh, my God. Marty?

554
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:37,818
Yeah, I knew
I recognized your voice.

555
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:40,124
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

556
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:42,825
I don't know no Marty.
New guy.

557
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:45,562
Hey, asshole,
it's me, Dave.

558
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:49,468
Dave? Why are you
dressed like Kick-Ass?

559
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,940
Because I'm Kick-Ass.

560
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,203
COLONEL: You two
know each other?

561
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:54,836
(CHUCKLES) Yeah,
like since we were five.

562
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:58,677
What's all this bullshit
about your parents
getting killed?

563
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,341
Yeesh, language.
What?

564
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,147
Battle Guy, care to
update your résumé?

565
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,385
(SIGHS) Uh...

566
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,549
I'm trying to figure out
how to explain this

567
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:10,424
without sounding like
a complete idiot right now.

568
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,759
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's possible, Batman.

569
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:13,889
MARTY: I'm not, either.

570
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,795
Um...

571
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:17,425
Okay. Well, when I found
you guys online,

572
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:20,096
you were all swapping
these awesome
origin stories.

573
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,163
I mean, Colonel,
you're ex-Mafia,
for Christ's sake.

574
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:25,333
Yo. Don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

575
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,035
I'm sorry.

576
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,204
I didn't think you'd
let me join the team

577
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,341
unless I had
a good story, too.

578
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:37,281
All right, we'll let you
off the hook this time,
Battle Guy.

579
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:40,287
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.

580
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,024
I thought this could
be our meeting room.

581
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,496
DAVE: Whoa, this is so cool.

582
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,928
Now this little renovation
was totally clandestine,

583
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:50,194
which means nobody
knew about it.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

584
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:54,499
Now, I know it's
not much, but this is
just the beginning.

585
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,368
Together we can make
a real difference.

586
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,533
Whoa!

587
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,344
If you'd consider it,
Kick-Ass,

588
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,175
we'd be honored
to have you join us.

589
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:07,474
Hell, yeah!
(ALL CHEERING)

590
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:10,212
That's what
I like to hear.

591
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:13,051
Right, time for initiation.

592
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,490
Turn around
and I'll unzip you.

593
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,749
I'm sorry, what?

594
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,819
Just joking.
Let's get down
to business.

595
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,660
(ALL LAUGHING)
Gotcha.

596
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,799
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
BROOKE: There you are.

597
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,860
We saved you
a seat in the caf,
but you never showed.

598
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:28,564
I usually head over
to the Olive Garden
to carb load.

599
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,406
I haven't had white sugar
since my first birthday.

600
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:32,773
Do we need
a thintervention?

601
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:36,244
Come on, best way
to tighten up a tummy
is varsity dance team.

602
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:38,611
The sign-up sheet
just went up.

603
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:43,646
It's still blowing
my mind. Kick-Ass.

604
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:44,746
It's like finding out
your best friend's

605
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:46,188
always been Will Smith,
you know?

606
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,247
(BOTH LAUGHING)

607
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,884
Hi, guys. What are you
talking about?

608
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:51,325
Nothing.

609
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,190
Nothing?
Yeah, Todd, nothing.

610
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,358
All right.
See you around, guys.

611
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,259
Todd, wait.

612
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,105
Ow, watch it.
Watch me end your life.

613
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:04,469
Come on. Forget it.

614
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:06,841
Just one of the dickheads
that follows
The Motherfucker on Twitter.

615
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:07,901
Who?

616
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:09,139
The Motherfucker.
He's some guy

617
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,738
claiming to be the world's
first supervillain.

618
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:12,578
He's got 1,000
followers already.

619
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:13,709
What an asshole.

Get some!
Uh-huh! Yeah!

622
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:18,886
You got this, Motherfucker!

623
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,617
You really think
he's got a shot?

624
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:22,387
I wouldn't take
his money if I didn't.

625
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:24,155
MMA is like chess.

626
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:27,494
It's all about the moves.
And your boy
really knows his stuff.

627
00:31:29,768 --> 00:31:31,599
Time to die, asshole.

You all right?
I'm cool. Ow!

631
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:39,744
Good job.
Nice jab, buddy.

632
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,278
Come on, stay loose, baby.
Walk it off, walk it off.

Chuck! Get this girl off me!

Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

641
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,592
You all right, Chris?
You all right, buddy?

642
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,395
Get off me!
I was winning.

643
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:04,958
No, you were crying.

644
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:09,535
You know what?
Screw this.
My super power

645
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,373
is that I'm rich as shit.

646
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,139
Hey, you wanna
work for me, huh?

647
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,009
You wanna beat
people up for me?

648
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:18,941
Sure.
All right!

649
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,745
Let's get you
a mask and a costume,

650
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:24,118
and we will call you
Black Death.

651
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,487
Whoa, whoa, you don't think
that's just a little
bit incredibly racist?

652
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:28,752
I don't give a shit.

653
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,294
I want you
to put the word out

654
00:32:30,362 --> 00:32:32,023
that I'm willing
to pay top dollar

655
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:33,291
for every hired
hitter in town.

656
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,558
Come on, come on.
Just talk about it first.

657

Money talks.

658
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,029
You wanted me
to be my own man.

659
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,570
This is
what it looks like.

660
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,004
All right, all right,
I'll make some calls.
Yes!

661

be a supervillain?

Promise I pay better than

What did you call me?
No, no, man.

the head. Doesn't know
what he's saying.

privately with Coach Podell.

666
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:59,920
And by studying,
I mean my mom paid her off
to make me varsity.

667
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:03,687
So, if you're half decent,
I'll make sure
she puts you on the team.

668
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,352
At least as an alternate.

669
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,057
You'd do that for me?

670
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,490
Besties stick together.

If Brooke wants a pet,
she should just get a dog.

672

to recreate Mindy
in her own image.

All right, ladies,
have a seat.
Let's get started.

But the truth is,
the only person

989
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:08,390

You just be yourself
and you let me be nervous.

997
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:39,348
Don't worry about me.
I can kill a man
with his own finger.

998
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:42,482
A word of advice,
I wouldn't open with that.

Why is this party in

right?

This isn't where you
have a party, moron.

it's real life!

1695
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:20,578
When you're dead,
it's done.
There's no sequel.

1696
01:32:20,715 --> 01:32:25,448
You made this real.
You started it!
And I'm gonna finish it.

1697
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:29,153
I'll be immortal,
like an evil Jesus.

1698
01:32:39,634 --> 01:32:40,623
Wait!

1699
01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:42,728
(SCREAMING)

1700
01:32:46,474 --> 01:32:47,463
(EXHALES)

1701
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,772
(GASPING)

1702
01:32:53,214 --> 01:32:55,512
I'm alive. (LAUGHS)

1703
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:56,947
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1704
01:33:01,322 --> 01:33:02,311
(YELLS)

1705
01:33:06,227 --> 01:33:08,491
DAVE: The feeling
was indescribable.

1706
01:33:08,963 --> 01:33:11,158
Chris D'Amico, dead.

1707
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,632
His wannabe supervillains,
defeated.

1708
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:20,004
But did we make
the world a better place?

1709
01:33:20,942 --> 01:33:25,606
Or did we just finish
something that began when
I first put on this mask?

1710
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:30,440
The cops are coming.

1711
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:32,643
TOMMY'S MUM:
They'll take care
of the bad guys.

1712
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,655
We better skedaddle
before they get here.

1713
01:33:36,257 --> 01:33:37,281
We did it.

1714
01:33:37,358 --> 01:33:38,347
Fuck, yeah.

1715
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:40,155
Hey, language.

1716
01:33:40,628 --> 01:33:45,156
You're right, if we're
gonna dress like heroes,
we should act like heroes.

1717
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:48,328
He'd be proud
of you, Dave.

1718
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,200
He'd be proud
of all of us.

1719
01:33:53,107 --> 01:33:55,541
You know we can never
do this again, right?

1720
01:33:57,578 --> 01:33:58,909
It's over.

1721
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:04,675
One last time.
Come on.

1722
01:34:08,589 --> 01:34:11,922
What do you say,
Hit Girl? Are you in?

1723
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:15,526
Why the hell not?

1724
01:34:17,332 --> 01:34:19,323
ALL: Justice Forever!

1725
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:33,877
(EXHALES)
Thanks for the ride.

1726
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:36,408
I'll see you at school.

1727
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,380
I'm leaving
New York, Dave.

1728
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:44,481
I can't go home.
I can't put Marcus
in that position.

1729
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:47,718
Why? He won't arrest you.
You just saved the city.

1730
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:50,854
Yeah, well,
I also killed six guys
with a cop's gun.

1731
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:53,365
Vigilantes don't
get a free pass.

1732
01:34:54,068 --> 01:34:57,663
You can't go.
People need you.

1733
01:34:58,873 --> 01:35:00,636
They've got you now.
Mindy... (LAUGHS)

1734
01:35:03,277 --> 01:35:04,801
I'm not like you.

1735
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:08,382
You don't have to be
a bad-ass to be
a superhero, Dave.

1736
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:12,578
You just have to be brave.

1737
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:25,624
What was that?

1738
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:30,736
That was my first kiss.

1739
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:36,098
Be nice
or I'll rip your ass
out through your mouth.

1740
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:44,348
DAVE: When Mindy left,

1741
01:35:45,053 --> 01:35:48,386
that's when
I finally understood
where my life was going.

1742
01:35:49,424 --> 01:35:52,018
Just like it had to
eventually happen,

1743
01:35:52,093 --> 01:35:55,187
that real people would
try to be superheroes.

1744
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:58,526
Eventually
it had to end, too.

1745
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:18,883
Superheroes can't exist
in the real world
for a reason.

1746
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:23,013
It's because
the real world
needs real heroes.

1747
01:36:23,758 --> 01:36:27,023
And not some punk
in a wet-suit
playing dress-up,

1748
01:36:27,595 --> 01:36:32,032
but a genuine bad-ass
who can really kick ass.

1749
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:19,910
CHRIS: Hello?

1750
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:23,205
Please. Don't go.

1751
01:42:24,051 --> 01:42:25,609
Don't go.

1752
01:42:25,686 --> 01:42:26,880
(GROANS)

1753
01:42:26,954 --> 01:42:28,717
Is anybody there?

1754
01:42:29,423 --> 01:42:30,754
(GROANING)

1755
01:42:31,892 --> 01:42:33,223
Hello?

1756
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:35,592
(GROANING)

1757
01:42:37,398 --> 01:42:39,832
(GRUNTS) Some help, please?

1758
01:42:39,967 --> 01:42:43,630
A shark bit my
fucking dick off and
I can't get some water?

1759
01:42:43,704 --> 01:42:45,433
(GRUNTING)

1760
01:42:47,274 --> 01:42:48,332
(STRAINS)
