           color they were.

12:54:48,055 --> 12:54:49,288
                   So...        

667
12:54:49,357 --> 12:54:52,224
 Jesus, this is the worst       
 meeting I've ever been in.     

668
12:54:52,293 --> 12:54:54,760
   A black man follows me       
   everywhere when it's sunny.  

669
12:54:54,829 --> 12:54:57,029
      Actually, I think that's  
      your shadow, Brick.       

670
12:54:57,098 --> 12:54:58,497
        I call him Leon.        

671
12:54:58,566 --> 12:55:00,733
     And if it's a cloudy day,  
     what happens to Leon?      

672
12:55:00,801 --> 12:55:01,934
                 He goes home.  

673
12:55:02,003 --> 12:55:03,936
            It's your shadow.   
            He's talking about  
            his shadow.         

674
12:55:04,005 --> 12:55:06,572
     Shut your damn mouths!     
     Sit down!

12:55:09,210 --> 12:55:10,442
      What's he doing?          

676
12:55:10,511 --> 12:55:13,112
     I think you scared him.    
     You can't shout at Brick.  

677
12:55:13,181 --> 12:55:15,047
        Is he all right?        

678
12:55:15,116 --> 12:55:17,616
       Can you sing him         
       a soothing siren song?   

679

       along with you.

                him a balloon.

           No, it's okay!       
           It's okay.           

688
12:55:37,738 --> 12:55:39,972
   So you have a black boss,    
   and it's freaking you out.   

689
12:55:40,041 --> 12:55:41,307
     Is it freaking you out?

     you guys get numbers,

 get along just fine.

      I am gonna be icy.

705
12:56:14,909 --> 12:56:16,809

  by coming on so strong?

           Okay, okay.

  what you are doing with him.

     Hey. That's my mama, man.  
     Please, don't do this.     

1575
13:09:30,959 --> 13:09:33,292
  Now, which one of you

 RON: Oh, I don't think         
 that dinner could've           
 gone any better.               

1578
13:09:37,665 --> 13:09:39,065
         LINDA: (YELLING)       
         Are you nuts?          

1579
13:09:39,133 --> 13:09:42,268
 No, I'm not!                   
 I had a wonderful evening!     

1580
13:09:42,337 --> 13:09:44,337
      My dad was kicking you    
      in the head!              

1581
13:09:44,405 --> 13:09:47,240
     I thought it was like      
     being jumped into a gang.  

1582
13:09:47,308 --> 13:09:48,808
      Only with dinner guests!  

1583
13:09:48,877 --> 13:09:51,344
      You called my family      
      "pipe-hittin' bitches!"   

1584
13:09:51,412 --> 13:09:54,280
          I hate to             
          pin it on you, but    

1585
13:09:54,349 --> 13:09:55,681
          you did               
          invite me to dinner.  

1586
13:09:56,417 --> 13:09:57,683
      I'm sorry. I'm sorry.     

1587
13:09:57,752 --> 13:09:59,619
 No, I'm sorry.                 
                    I just...   

1588
13:09:59,687 --> 13:10:02,421
 I'm just under                 
 a lot of stress because...     

1589
13:10:02,490 --> 13:10:04,624
              Because Allenby,  
              he doesn't        
              want you to do

      you're doing for sweeps.  

1591
13:10:07,161 --> 13:10:08,261
          "Death From Above."   

1592
13:10:08,329 --> 13:10:09,829
 It's an excellent story.       
 Wonderful expose.              

1593
13:10:09,898 --> 13:10:11,564
          Listen, Ron.          

1594
13:10:12,700 --> 13:10:14,700
           Have you ever heard  
           of synergy?          

1595
13:10:20,708 --> 13:10:23,142
    So your mom thought         
    we should get together,     

1596
13:10:23,211 --> 13:10:25,778
   spend a little time.         

1597
13:10:25,847 --> 13:10:29,448
   She doesn't think I connect  
   with you as a child.         

1598
13:10:30,852 --> 13:10:33,052
       Can you believe          
       that bullshit?           
       (SCOFFS)                 

1599
13:10:34,589 --> 13:10:36,589
           Dad.                 
                 Huh?           

1600
13:10:36,658 --> 13:10:38,424
         Sometimes I hear       
         sounds at night        

1601
13:10:38,493 --> 13:10:39,959
       and I get scared.        

1602
13:10:40,028 --> 13:10:42,828
    I think there's             
    a ghost in my closet.       

1603
13:10:42,897 --> 13:10:44,597
       Now, you                 
       listen to me, son.       

1604
13:10:44,666 --> 13:10:48,701
     There is no such thing     
     as ghosts. Case closed.    

1605
13:10:48,770 --> 13:10:50,569
           So what's real       
           that's scary?        

1606
13:10:50,638 --> 13:10:51,704
     You really want to know    

1607
13:10:51,773 --> 13:10:53,906
      the one thing             
      you should be afraid of?  

1608
13:10:53,975 --> 13:10:56,008
        Yes, I really do.       

1609
13:10:56,077 --> 13:10:58,044
                  Voodoo.       
           Voodoo?              

1610
13:10:58,112 --> 13:10:59,512
                  Yes, voodoo.  

1611
13:10:59,580 --> 13:11:01,514
            That shit will      
            mess you up.        

1612
13:11:01,582 --> 13:11:04,483
          And it is 100% real.  

1613
13:11:04,552 --> 13:11:06,218
            Promise me          

1614
13:11:06,287 --> 13:11:07,920
           that you'll never    
           go to Haiti.         

1615
13:11:07,989 --> 13:11:09,555
        I promise, Dad.         

1616
13:11:09,624 --> 13:11:11,857
    This was good. I enjoyed    
    spending time with you.     

1617
13:11:11,926 --> 13:11:13,092
            Me, too, Dad.       

1618
13:11:13,161 --> 13:11:15,561
        Oh, and hey.            
        Do you want to          
        go to Haiti sometime?   

1619
13:11:15,630 --> 13:11:17,630
            No.                 
            Good. Good.         

1620
13:11:17,699 --> 13:11:19,632
 (YELLING)                      
 What did you tell him?         

1621
13:11:19,701 --> 13:11:21,367
  I didn't tell him anything.   

1622
13:11:21,436 --> 13:11:23,769
   He hasn't slept              
   for four days, Ron!          

1623
13:11:23,838 --> 13:11:26,772
 Everywhere we go,              
 he asks me                     
 if we're going to Haiti!       

1624
13:11:26,841 --> 13:11:28,040
    What does that even mean?   

1625
13:11:28,109 --> 13:11:31,310
   I am so sick and tired       
   that you've sheltered him    

1626
13:11:31,379 --> 13:11:33,079
    from the evils of voodoo.   

1627
13:11:33,147 --> 13:11:35,982
 You need to learn to connect   
 with him in a healthy way!     

1628
13:11:36,050 --> 13:11:38,184
     Let me ask you something,  
     and I'm not trying         
     to be funny here.          

1629
13:11:38,252 --> 13:11:41,020
Are you sure he's not a midget  
with a learning disability?     

1630
13:11:41,089 --> 13:11:44,256
 He is seven years old, Ron.    

1631
13:11:44,325 --> 13:11:45,925
         All right.             
       <i> Now listen to me.</i>       

1632
13:11:45,994 --> 13:11:49,362
    He has a science fair       
    tomorrow, at 8:00,          

1633
13:11:49,430 --> 13:11:51,030
       and he wants you         
       to be there.             

1634
13:11:51,099 --> 13:11:53,799
        I will be there.        
        All right?              

1635
13:11:53,868 --> 13:11:55,334
      Now, who do you have      
      for sweeps week?          

1636
13:11:55,403 --> 13:11:57,603
 I'm not discussing             
 work with you, Ron, okay?      

1637
13:11:57,672 --> 13:12:00,406
 Just be there                  
 at the science fair tomorrow.  

1638
13:12:00,475 --> 13:12:02,475
             Fine!

    We're going to get crushed  
    in ratings. Just crushed.   

1650
13:12:29,437 --> 13:12:31,804
 I really thought we had        
 a chance this time.            

1651
13:12:31,873 --> 13:12:34,206
     What about my              
     "Death From Above" story?  

1652
13:12:35,476 --> 13:12:38,144
            You better ask Ron  
            about that.         

1653
13:12:39,113 --> 13:12:40,579
    We're pulling that story,   
    Brian.                      

1654
13:12:40,648 --> 13:12:43,516
              What? Why?        
              I worked hard     
              on that story.    

1655
13:12:43,584 --> 13:12:45,017
     It was my call,            
     all right, Brian?          

1656
13:12:45,086 --> 13:12:46,986
  Just let it go.               
  It's synergy.                 

1657
13:12:47,055 --> 13:12:48,154
          What does that mean?  

1658
13:12:48,222 --> 13:12:49,922
 Take it easy, Ron.             

1659
13:12:49,991 --> 13:12:52,591
 We got further than anybody    
 thought we would.              
 We'll get 'em next time.       

1660
13:12:52,660 --> 13:12:54,060
        You take it easy!       

1661
13:12:54,128 --> 13:12:55,795
        I'm not in this         
        to finish second!       

1662
13:12:55,863 --> 13:12:57,463
        I think Champ           
        is just saying...       

1663
13:12:57,532 --> 13:13:00,833
 I know what he was trying      
 to say, Brian, okay?           

1664
13:13:00,902 --> 13:13:03,702
 And it doesn't                 
 surprise me that               
 you guys don't care.           

1665
13:13:03,771 --> 13:13:07,106
    Let's face it,              
    I'm the one                 
    who gets the ratings.       

1666
13:13:07,175 --> 13:13:10,209
 I'm starting to wonder         
 what you clowns actually do.   

1667
13:13:10,278 --> 13:13:13,279
    Chani likes clowns.

            a little bit down,  

2133
13:34:17,143 --> 13:34:19,344
        but this is definitely  
        picking up my mood.     

2134
13:34:19,412 --> 13:34:21,546
          Well, I guess I'll    
          leave you two alone.  

2135
13:34:21,614 --> 13:34:24,749

         an absolute pleasure,  
         Ms. Corningstone.

 Ron. Read the room.            

2139
13:34:29,956 --> 13:34:31,356
 I'll take that as a no.        

2140
13:34:32,092 --> 13:34:34,292

 been returning my messages.    

2142
13:34:36,596 --> 13:34:40,765
 I wasn't calling for me,       
 I was calling because Walter   
 has a piano recital

13:34:40,834 --> 13:34:43,801
 in half an hour

 on 65th Street.                

2144
13:34:43,870 --> 13:34:46,504
 And he wrote                   
 a piece for you, Ron.          

2145
13:34:46,573 --> 13:34:48,239
                 Aw, Walter.    

2146

2198
13:37:08,848 --> 13:37:12,950
     I made love to a proud,    
     intelligent black woman.

13:37:14,254 --> 13:37:16,254
    I became blind.             

2200
13:37:16,322 --> 13:37:19,056
   I bottle-fed                 
   and raised a shark.          

2201
13:37:19,125 --> 13:37:22,093
     And I smoked               
     a fair amount of crack.    

2202
13:37:22,161 --> 13:37:24,729
  But the most important thing  
  I've learned is that          

2203
13:37:24,797 --> 13:37:27,164
   there was an emptiness left

2492
13:52:12,584 --> 13:52:15,986
          There's one story     
          that shows how good   
          a person Chani is.    

2493
13:52:17,623 --> 13:52:21,091
        We were leaving dinner  
        at one of our favorite

2494
13:52:21,160 --> 13:52:23,627

            drop his wallet.    

2495
13:52:23,695 --> 13:52:25,729
        Chani immediately       
        picked it up and said,  

2496
13:52:25,798 --> 13:52:31,601
   "We are rich!"               
   Then she bought $200 worth   
   of Slim Jims and magazines.  

2497
13:52:31,670 --> 13:52:34,171
      She then threw            
      the wallet into a river.
