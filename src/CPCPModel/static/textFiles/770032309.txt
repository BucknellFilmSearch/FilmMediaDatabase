00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:47,411
WHO OFFICIAL:
How are we defining "contained?"

167
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:50,576
LEOPOLD: They're using the same protocols
established for SARS.

168
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:53,515
They're quarantining the complex
and screening for symptoms.

169
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,349
ORANTES: Kowloon is the most densely
populated area in the world...

170
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,388
...and Hong Kong is a harbor.

171
00:12:58,558 --> 00:12:59,684
It's going to spread.

172
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,454
LEOPOLD:
Hong Kong is sending us blood samples.

173
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,189
We're also looking at samples
from London.

174
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:09,165
Two clusters: One at a hotel,
the other at a health club.

175
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:12,305
Five dead, encephalitis.

176
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:16,533
And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo.

177
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,840
- Three dead in that cluster.
- Any of them travel to China or London?

178
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,078
We're checking.

179
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,781
PARAMEDIC:
Mr. Neal, I want you to stay with me here.

180
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:33,449
Can you hear me?
Have you had seizures before? Mr. Neal?

181
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:36,619
- I want you to open your eyes if you can.
MRS. NEAL: He's breathing, right?

182
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:40,198
[SOBBING] I couldn't wake him.
I got home, I couldn't wake him.

183
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,665
We both woke up sick this morning.

184
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,301
PARAMEDIC:
Watch your head.

185
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,406
[SAW BUZZING]

186
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:04,080
MEDICAL EXAMINER:
Hmm...

187
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:10,822
Well, the sulci are obliterated.
Let's look at the base.

188
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,032
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,802
You want me to take a sample, or?

190
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,498
I want you to move away from the table.

191
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:27,272
- Should I call someone, or?
- Call everyone.

192
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,157
CHEEVER: Well, these things happen
up there from time to time.

193
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:42,352
Meningitis in a college dorm
after a swim meet...

194
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,056
...or West Nile in some summer camp
near a lake.

195
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,294
I was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.

196
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,665
A hundred and three cases,
mainly children.

197
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,467
Well, it's probably too cold up there
for that right now.

198
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,611
As of last night,
there were five deaths and 32 cases.

199
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,769
There's a cluster
in an elementary school.

200
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:03,381
That's the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for.

201
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,142
It's gonna be all over the news.

202
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:08,185
What's your single overriding
communications objective?

203
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:11,882
We're isolating the sick and quarantining
those who we believe were exposed.

204
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,582
Okay, good.

205
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,524
As of this moment,
you and I are attached at the cell phone.

206
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,427
If you need resources, call me.
If you get into a political dogfight, call me.

207
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,592
If you find yourself wide awake,
staring at the walls at 3 a. M...

208
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,000
...wondering why you took the job,
call me.

209
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,437
DAVE: I sure hope you packed something
warmer than that.

210
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:32,135
We're looking at around zero
with the windchill.

211
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,341
Don't want you to catch cold.

212
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,682
Do you wanna go to the hotel first,
get situated?

213
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:43,448
MEARS:
I'd prefer to get started, if that's possible.

214
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,614
DAVE: Okay.
MEARS: How far is the office?

215
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,817
About a half-hour from here.

216
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:08,646
DOCTOR:
Your dad's in isolation.

217
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:12,180
You can go up to the window,
pick up the phone, and you can talk to him.

218
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,264
MITCH: Hey.
- Dad.

219
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,801
- Hey.
- Are you sick?

220
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:33,439
No, no, no. I'm... Uh...

221
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:37,202
This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.

222
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:40,005
But you were with them.
You could still get it.

223
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,276
No, I won't. Um,
they said this happens really, really fast.

224
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:47,978
And, uh, I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

225
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,885
There's nothing wrong with me.
We're okay. We're okay.

226
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:55,091
And Clark?

227
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,324
Yeah, you know, I, um...

228
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:06,930
I wasn't there.
I went, uh, in the ambulance with, uh, Beth.

229
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:10,804
And, uh, I just didn't... I...

230
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:13,946
I left him with, uh, Carrie Anne.

231
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,411
I should have been there.

232
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:18,347
- I could have helped.
- No, no, no. Honey, no, no.

233
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:20,509
It's good that you weren't there.
I'm happy.

234
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:23,781
If something had happened to you,
I mean, I'd...

235
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:28,052
Honey, you're here now, you know.
I'm happy about that.

236
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,253
I'm happy about that.

237
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:33,226
When are you coming home?

238
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,891
Soon. Very soon. They, you know...

239
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:39,197
- Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
- No.

240
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:42,637
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
- No. She doesn't need me.

241
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,109
She's got Dan. I live here.

242
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:52,413
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.

243
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:56,713
OFFICIAL 1: We have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.

244
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,381
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.

245
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,619
People are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.

246
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,663
At this point, I think
we have to believe this is respiratory.

247
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:08,562
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?

248
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:11,966
Uh, it refers to transmission
from surfaces.

249
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,539
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.

250
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:20,976
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.

251
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,082
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

252
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,980
...water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.

253
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:29,553
Those things become fomites.

254
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:33,090
Is this something we wanna release
to the press? Respiratory and fomites?

255
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,956
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

256
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,622
...will keep people from getting
in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes...

257
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,258
We need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.

258
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:48,669
I mean, heh, we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.

259
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,936
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.

260
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:53,909
It's the biggest shopping weekend
of the year.

261
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,877
OFFICIAL 2:
We need to consider closing schools.

262
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:59,280
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

263
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,716
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.

264
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,415
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

265
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,890
Things that keep people calm.

266
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:12,725
What we need to determine is this:

267
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:15,629
For every person who gets sick...

268
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:19,397
...how many other people
are they likely to infect?

269
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,236
So for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.

270
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,971
Smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.

271
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,614
Now, before we had a vaccine...

272
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:33,116
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

273
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,312
Now, we call that number...

274
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,717
...the R-nought.

275
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:43,727
R stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.

276
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,161
Any ideas what that might be for this?

277
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:50,496
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

278
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,537
The incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.

279
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,937
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

280
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,771
We need to know that too.

281
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:03,109
We need to know how big the population
of people susceptible to the virus might be.

282
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:06,343
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

283
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,512
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

284
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,523
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

285
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,490
We sent samples to the CDC.

286
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:21,023
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.

287
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,066
Clearly, we're not lucky.

288

EISENBERG:
What do we got?

00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:57,992
A young woman in Minnesota,
recently traveled to China.

290
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:00,298
Son also died.

291
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:05,069
As of this morning, 87 cases, 15 deaths.

You? Really?

Texas. Salmonella. Pretty limited.

- Mine was great, thanks.
- Oh.

296
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:32,435
It's pleomorphic,
but tends toward ovoid in shape.

297
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,540
I see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...

298
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,142
...but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.

299
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:41,303
We tested all her antibodies.
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.

300
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:44,848
Her body had no idea what to do with it.
It just kept amplifying.

301

HEXTALL:
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.

302
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,146
If he doesn't know what it is,
nobody does.

303
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:53,918
It shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin.

304
00:21:54,093 --> 00:22:00,054
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 10 genes.

305
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,928
Typical of a paramyxovirus.

306
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:06,731
It's Godzilla, King Kong
and Frankenstein all in one.

You're not a doctor
and you're not a writer.

Yes, I am a writer. Yes, I am.

311
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:20,946
Blogging is not writing.
It's graffiti with punctuation.

312
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,817
I am a journalist, and there's
informed discussion on the blogosphere...

313
00:22:24,991 --> 00:22:26,982
...that this is a biological weapon.

314
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,221
You wanna talk to me,
call my office and make an appointment.

00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:39,997
- Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

317
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:43,506
We found him. Tell the unit
on the way to his house to come in.

318
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,940
Excuse me. Who are you?

319
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:49,172
My name is Dennis French
with the Department of Homeland Security.

320
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:51,180
And what's this all about?

321
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:54,684
Rear Admiral Haggerty's expecting us
in the emergency operations center.

322
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,049
We can discuss it there.

323
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,020
FRENCH:
This happened in Kowloon.

324
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:03,185
Today we've got workers at a casino
in Macao striking over conditions.

325
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:07,857
Three have died in one bunkhouse.

...and we've modeled the way

The blue is virus, and the gold is human,
and the red is the viral attachment protein...

...and the green is its receptor
in the human cells.

427

These receptors are found in the cells
of both the respiratory tract...

[English - US - SDH]

1332
01:46:41,424 --> 01:46:43,585
NARRATOR: This is an influenza virus.
This is the world.

1333
01:46:43,759 --> 01:46:45,488
How can a virus change the world?
Here's how:

1334
01:46:45,661 --> 01:46:47,686
A virus survives by jumping
from one host to another...

1335
01:46:47,864 --> 01:46:49,798
...and hijacking its cells
for its own purposes.

1336
01:46:49,966 --> 01:46:51,399
With each jump, the virus mutates.

1337
01:46:51,567 --> 01:46:54,035
Enough mutations, our virus
can jump to different species.

1338
01:46:54,203 --> 01:46:56,899
Influenza tends to jump
from birds and pigs to humans.

1339
01:46:57,073 --> 01:46:58,768
Let's say the virus
jumps into a human host.

1340
01:46:58,941 --> 01:47:01,432
Worse, this iteration is capable
of jumping from human to human.

1341
01:47:01,611 --> 01:47:05,047
This first case is the index patient.
He unknowingly infects other people.

1342
01:47:05,214 --> 01:47:07,705
Those people infect more people
until we have an epidemic.

1343
01:47:07,884 --> 01:47:10,444
Let's say that epidemic continues
to spread across the planet.

1344
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,144
Like Bieber Fever, but deadlier.

1345
01:47:12,321 --> 01:47:13,549
This is called a pandemic.

1346
01:47:13,723 --> 01:47:15,190
What happens when a pandemic strikes?

1347
01:47:15,358 --> 01:47:17,519
In 1918, the Spanish flu
caused 50 million deaths.

1348
01:47:17,693 --> 01:47:20,787
That's more casualties than World War I,
which was going on at the same time.

1349
01:47:20,963 --> 01:47:24,023
P.S., it wasn't just the old and weak,
the young and healthy got it the worst.

1350
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,394
But it's not always so nasty.

1351
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:29,732
SARS was curbed before it got out of hand.
But say a full-on pandemic did happen.

1352
01:47:29,906 --> 01:47:31,601
First, public gathering spaces
are closed.

1353
01:47:31,774 --> 01:47:33,765
The forever-alone among us
may not even notice it.

1354
01:47:33,943 --> 01:47:36,605
Public transit and international travel slow
or shut down entirely.

1355
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:37,837
But what if it keeps going?

1356
01:47:38,014 --> 01:47:41,279
The good news is you'll be able to spend
more time in your favorite sweatpants.

1357
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:44,283
Governments declare states of emergency
and quarantines are established.

1358
01:47:44,453 --> 01:47:46,751
Common luxuries like food and water
are tricky to locate...

the dining experience of MREs...

1360
01:47:49,358 --> 01:47:50,757
...eaten with oh-so-elegant sporks.

1361
01:47:50,927 --> 01:47:54,226
Private business slows, which leads to
a recession on top of the pandemic.

1362
01:47:54,397 --> 01:47:56,695
And we have to endure
the inevitable, terrible aid song...

1363
01:47:56,866 --> 01:47:59,801
...recorded by the most obnoxious
artists in popular music.

1364
01:47:59,969 --> 01:48:03,769
But fear not, we can do plenty of little
things to prevent this worst-case scenario.

1365
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:05,271
One, wash your hands often.

1366
01:48:05,441 --> 01:48:08,239
Researchers estimate that if everybody
washed their hands regularly...

1367
01:48:08,411 --> 01:48:10,038
...a million deaths could be prevented
every year.

1368
01:48:10,212 --> 01:48:11,941
Two, get your flu vaccine every year.

1369
01:48:12,114 --> 01:48:15,140
Health experts create new vaccines
each year to counter new flu strains.

Three, if you feel sick,
stay away from people and see a doctor.

If you've got influenza,
you can infect people up to 6 feet away.

1372
01:48:21,357 --> 01:48:23,791
Four, develop an emergency plan
and stock up on supplies.
