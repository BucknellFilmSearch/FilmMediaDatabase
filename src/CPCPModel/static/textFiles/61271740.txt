1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,500
ner.                            

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,501
             Change the station.

3
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,736
        More music, less Marcus.

4
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,905
           If you open the door,

5
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,774
       he'll be a black Dr. Phil
       for the next 40 minutes. 

6
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,479
    Syd, you might not want     
  to get too flirty with Mike.  

7
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,181
  Your boyfriend might cut off  
      his trigger finger.       

8
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,885
               Maybe Mike's been
               flirting with me.

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,087
              Did you ever think
              about that?       

10
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,589
                    Ooh...Mm-mm.

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,158
         Trigger Mike?          

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,460
Not like this.                  
Don't play with the boy.        

13
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,928
Seriously.                      
Don't play with the boy.        

14
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,796
 Just tell him about New York.  

15
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,698
Do it.                          
         Tell me what?          

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,867
         Oh, shit. Is he        
         walking down the steps?

17
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,137
Oh, shit.                       
He coming down.                 

18
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,372
                      It's okay.

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,507
                  Yeah, you done
                  fucked up.    

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,708
             You done fucked up.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,212
Um, you remember...             

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,147
Remember I went to New York?    
You remember?                   

23
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:54,052
And...I said, "Syd."            

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,387
I ran in--                      

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,522
Syd ran into me                 
in New York                     

26
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,224
on the street in that place.    

27
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,194
And I said, "What's up?"        

28
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,464
And we was hungry,              
so then...                      

29
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:09,267
she had fish.                   

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,337
It was grouper,                 

31
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,871
and then I had                  
some chicken.                   

32
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,740
Remember I was supposed         
to come home,                   

33
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,377
but I didn't?                   

34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,946
          We went out on a date.

35
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,815
                 Five, actually.

36
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:24,816
                Now we're seeing
                each other.     

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,852
    Hold up.                    

38
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,788
You know, really out of         
respect for you, Marcus,        

39
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,889
you know,                       
nothing happened.               

40
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,227
           Hey, Mike,           
     why you tripping, man?     

41
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,396
 I mean, we wanted to make sure 
   that you was cool with it.   

42
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,864
         Doesn't matter         
    what I think, you know?     

43
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,733
     Hey, I had to find out     
       like this, right?        

44
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,201
                   Don't matter.

45
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,236
                 Let me ask you,

46
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,237
                 y'all going    
                 to have babies?

47
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,071
  Little bunch of mini Mikes?   

48
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,541
     Bunch of little lying,     
     violent motherfuckers?     

49
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,610
   Marcus, nothing happened.    

50
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,878
      I just want to say,       
  Mama's going to be thrilled.  

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,079
All right,                      
you know what?                  

52
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,548
You need to go ahead and        
"whoosah" or something          

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,749
for a second.                   

54
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,750
           Hey, hey,            
    here comes the<i> Dixie 7.</i>     

55
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,253
            Whoosah.            

56
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,223
   Mike, just leave it alone.   

57
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,525
Why you acting                  
like that?                      

58
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,426
          Hey, Mike, go on about
          your business, man.   

59
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,561
No, we're going                 
to talk about this.             

60
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,562
    No, get out of my face.     

61
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,729
I'm trying to talk to you.      

62
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,199
   Get the fuck off me, Mike.   

63
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,568
              What the hell is  
              your problem, man?

64
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,136
       Why you acting so stupid?

65
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,238
This is a dysfunctional         
partnership.                    

66
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,006
That's why the fuck             
I'm acting like that.           

67
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,074
There ain't no trust,           
Mike.                           

68
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,576
            I didn't lie to you!

69
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,944
         I was waiting for the  
         right time to tell you,

70
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,180
             but that ain't     
             what your issue is.

71
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,581
            Why don't you       
            bring it to me real?

72
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,483
            What is your problem
            with this?          

73
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,919
You know what?                  
You a dog, man.                 

74
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,621
That's it. There it is.         
I said it.                      

75
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,822
                       Oh, okay.

76
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,224
You like a pit bull             

77
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,293
with that little pink thing     
hanging out, Mike.              

78
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:45,263
             Oh, it's like that.
             Oh, okay.          

79
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,666
             I'm not good enough
             for your sister.   

80
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,671
Guys, enough. The boat's coming.

81
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,840
               Okay. We going to
               handle that shit.

82
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,409
                  Go ahead, man.

83
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,417
       In about an hour,        
 the drop boat's going to come. 

84
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,435
          We got them.          

85
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,037
      Wonder what mortuary      
    that coffin's going to.     

86
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,218
         Keep going straight by.

87
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,327
     You seeing what I'm seeing?

88
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,035
 Get the load to the mortuary,  
      and don't screw up.       

89
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,771
I got it.                       

90
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,639
            Load up.            

91
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,185
     They're getting away!      

92
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,421
                     Stop! Stop!

93
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,989
               We need your car.
               All right?       

94
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,524
             Get out of the car.

95
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,859
  Can you not get a better car  
           than that?           

96
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,894
        Let that man go!        

97
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,895
     Don't be coming at me      

98
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,029
     with that tone, Mike.      

99
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,030
             Freak.             

100
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,266
        Small cars don't fuck up
        the ozone layer.        

101
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,267
That's what                     
I'm talking about.              

102
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,268
         Stop the car.          

103
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,269
Get--Yeah.                      

104
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,204
         Pop the trunk.         
        Get out. Get in.        

105
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,372
       Get out. Get out.        

106
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,740
Get your ass in.                

107
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,908
             Okay.              

108
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,543
 I am in the middle of a sale.  

109
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,711
       Do I have to pull my gun?

110
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,079
Oh, shit. Dan Marino.           
What's up?                      

111
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,715
Back up, Dan.                   
Hey, you're the truth.          

112
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,716
Whatever you need,              
officers.                       

113
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,717
That's Dan Marino.              

114
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,852
         Hey. Back up.          

115
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,853
Let me know how it rides.       

116
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,854
         Oh, he's gonna         

117
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,289
 test-drive the shit out this.  

118
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,525
        Go. I don't want        
       to blow my cover.        

119
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,763
Got them. Got them right there. 

120
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,780
      Mike, why do you got      
        to get so close?        

121
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,448
I'm not going to let            
that coffin get away.           

122
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,883
   But they're all around us,   
              man.              

123
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,951
Shit, those are the gangbangers.

124
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,587
               Relax, they don't
               know us.         

125
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,756
  Boss, we got a problem here.  
     We're being followed.      

126
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,459
 This is a big problem, Carlos. 

127
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,161
          Sorry, boss.          
  I'll take care of it, okay?   

128
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,898
 You kill those black bitches.  
           All right?           

129
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,099
  Shit. I think they made us.   

130
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,568
      Get some undercovers      
        to roll with us.        

131
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,570
   Okay, we're splitting up.    

132
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,171
         <i> Everybody go</i>          
   <i> to Third and Boxter, now!</i>   

133
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,343
          Here we go.           

134
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,355
        I didn't sign up        
  for no goddamned car chase!   

135
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,169
    Have you lost your mind?    

136
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,677
 Mike, I see you got your mind  
    set on doing dumb shit,     

137
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,545
     so please let me out!      

138
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,290
  I seen this in a movie once.  
      They didn't make it!      

139
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,359
             Mike!              

140
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,628
           Oh, shit!            

141
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,571
Dump truck!                     
                       I got it.

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,839
             Mike!              

143
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,408
             I'm fine. I'm fine.

144
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,913
Whoa! Whoa! Mike! Whoa!         
Right there!                    

145
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,615
Oh, shit, Mike!                 

146
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,250
          Did you see that shit?
No shit.                        

147
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,227
        Dan Marino should       
        definitely buy this car.

148
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,598
        But not this one.       
        I'm fucking this one up,

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,865
        but he should definitely
        get one like this.      

150
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,872
           All right,           
   that was almost fucked up.   

151
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,740
      I almost fucked up.       

152
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,213
     This is not necessary.     

153
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,291
           Oh, shit!            

154
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,731
Dead man on                     
the hood! Dead man!             

155
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,165
                  I'm trying    
                  to get it off.

156
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,033
                   I'm trying to
                   get it off.  

157
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,971
              That shit's nasty.
              That's nasty.     

158
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,406
             That shit is nasty.

159
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,062
       Undercover police!       
        Everybody move!         

160
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,666
    Undercover police! Move!    
       Move! Move! Move!        

161
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,808
              Oh!               

162
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,944
 Coming around the corner now!  

163
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,681
   Get ready, they're coming    
    around the block. Move!     

164
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:05,543
 Shit! Boy, if this was my car, 
         I'd be pissed!         

165
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,211
      Get down! Get down!       

166
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,384
Trying to break                 
the world record                

167
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,019
for gun fights in a week?       

168
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,288
      This is not the time      
         to criticize!          

169
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,523
           I can't work with you

170
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,990
              blaming shit on me
              all the time!     

171
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,526
This is not your fault?         

172
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,894
            This is not. No. No!

173
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,063
Bullshit, Mike!                 
Everything's your fault!        

174
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,040
   Okay, let's go! Let's go!    

175
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,017
      Clear around! Cool!       

176
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,157
       I'm going around!        

177
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,529
         Mike, got him!         

178
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,664
            They got the coffin.

179
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,578
             Move!              

180
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,446
     Move! Move! Get down!      
       Police! Get down!        

181
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,887
          Move! Move!           

182
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,458
Police! Move! Move!             
Get out of my way!              

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,893
Move! Move!                     

184
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,802
     Open the door! Police!     

185
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,107
          Whoa! Shit!           

186
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,377
          Mike! Mike!           

187
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,792
        That boy bit me!        

188
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,898
             Mike!              

189
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,084
          Move! Move!           

190
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,485
         Police! Move!          

191
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,403
                   Police! Move!

192
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:50,808
                 He under there?

193
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,845
             We lost the coffin,

194
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,781
       and you barbecued        
      our only lead, Mike.      

195
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,316
 This has got to be the worst,  

196
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,953
    most emotional cop week     
          of my life.           

197
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,755
Yeah, it's been a little rough. 

198
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,862
           Where were           
      these bodies going?       

199
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,232
         I don't know.          
      It's really strange.      

200
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,734
       All the John Does        
  we found out here are empty.  

201
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,071
     Empty Does. Fat Does.      

202
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,572
         Cut them open,         
      took the organs out,      

203
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,607
      sewed them back up.       

204
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,475
Nice work.                      

205
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,410
The more you guys fuck up,      

206
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,178
the more we look                
like rock stars, baby.          

207
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,513
         The van you was chasing

208
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,181
              is a transport for
              the city morgue.  

209
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,783
            These John Does here
            were being delivered

210
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,251
           to the university    
           for medical research.

211
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,186
          Nice going.           

212
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,421
   I can't believe you guys.    

213
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,090
      Do you both wake up       
        in the morning,         

214
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,257
      call each other up?       

215
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,259
    "Good morning, Marcus."     
     "Good morning, Mike."      

216
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,894
   "How you doing?" "A'ight."   

217
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,897
"So, how are we going to fuck up
   the captain's life today?"   

218
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,866
      "Gee, I don't know."      
        "I don't know."         

219
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,201
    "Ooh. Look, over there.     

220
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:56,240
  Let's kill three fat people   
 and leave them on the street." 

221
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,943
      Hey, they were dead       
    before we ran over them.    

222
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,412
 It doesn't matter whether they 
 were dead or not, goddamn it!  

223
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,117
 Every time you leave a corpse  
         on the street,         

224
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,453
         I have to get          
  these forensic coroner guys   

225
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,955
            to come             
   and to see what happened.    

226
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,792
Then I've got to get detectives.
  See? They're detecting shit.  

227
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,827
      Then I've got to get      
      these forensic guys       

228
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,430
       to stick them back       
      in the fucking bag!       

229
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,566
         Jesus Christ!          

230
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,468
You guys, you're like...        

231
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,305
You're like a bunch             
of bloodsucking ticks           

232
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,909
draining the life's blood       
out of this department.         

233
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,277
Whoosah.                        

234
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,578
               Damn the whoosah,
               captain.         

235
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,880
                 Did you just   
                 call me a tick?

236
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,247
    I was referring to him.     

237
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,583
     Captain, these are not     
        normal corpses.         

238
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,787
         If I threw you         
  out of a speeding ice truck   

239
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,454
  and then ran over your head,  

240
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,856
 you wouldn't be normal either. 

241
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,357
                Think about this
                for one second. 

242
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,126
           All of these bodies  
           have been emptied out

243
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,327
            from a drug smuggler

244
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,429
              that just happens 
              to own a mortuary,

245
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,098
        and I got a bunch       
        of bodies hanging around

246
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,299
             with plenty of room
             in them...         

247
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,234
   I could smuggle some shit.   

248
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,435
          Johnny Tapia          
     has the perfect cover.     

249
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,272
    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.     
         Johnny Tapia?          

250
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,275
  Yes. I want a warrant to go

Now, listen.

home at 10:01.                  

377
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,646

              you talking about?

454
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,292

a tube down your throat         

455
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,527
and they just suck out          
all the gunk and bile,          

456
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,996
because what happens is         
your body'll get gaseous        

457
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,997
and you'll decompose,           

458
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,232
and they don't want             
that shit to happen             

459
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,700

see you.                        

460
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,502
       Mike, I really don't need
       to know that now.        

461
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,969
They sew your mouth closed.     

462
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,338
They got to get all             
of that out,                    

463
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,006
because a lot of times,         
dead people'll fart.            

464
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,609
That shit'll clear              
a funeral home out.             

465
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,110
                 How do you know
                 all that?      

466
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:32,015

That shit got me.               

467
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,450
                       Oh, shit.

Why don't you check his spine   
while you're in there?          

473
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,706
I'm retching...                 

474

475
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,078
             What?              

476
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,614
       Have some dignity.       

477
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,648
          I ain't doing nothing.

478
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,915
     Cover her titties up.      

479
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,983
    Like, what am I gonna do    

480
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,753
with these big-ass dead titties?

481
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,255
  But you're looking, though.   

482
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,823
  There's...Something's wrong   
        with your brain.        

483
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,225
    Just cover the titties.     

484
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,593
             God...

  Take a picture of the money,  
     then check this body.      

492
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:39,182
  Nah, I'm gonna count these.   
           You know?            

493
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,450
        Check the body.         

494
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,085
I'm gonna check the body, Mike.

00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,154
    I'm not rushing into it,    
          that's all.           

496
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:49,693
This one's going to             
a mortuary in L.A.              

497
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,029
   I'm gonna check this one.    

498
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,520
      That's that bullshit      

499
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,087
that I be                       
talking about.                  

500
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,457
  Mike, the motherfucking head  
           fell off.            

501
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,559
           Come here.           

502
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:28,498
          I'm...I'm...          
  I'm back in the...game. Hoo!  

503
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,501
          Think I got something.

504
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,805
       Feels like a bag.        

505
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:36,840
   Shit, no, it's his kidney.   

506
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,018
      I smell dead people.      

507
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,021
        Drugs and money.        
       We got him, baby.        

508
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,000
            This dude is loaded.

509
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,002
         Bet he thinks          
      he's a damn genius,       

510
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,237
       transporting them        
      in dead bodies, huh?      

511
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,106
      Let's get this body.      

512
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,844
Mike, you've                    
got company, man.               

513
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,045
    Somebody's coming. Hide.    

514
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,181
                  Give me the X.
                  Give me the X.

515
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,217
     You gotta stall them.      

516
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,823
         [ALARM RINGS]          

517
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,626
       Hide! Hide! Hide!        

518
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,060
                         Shit!  

519
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,697
       Punk kids do this?       
        Go check it out.        

520
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,631
             Hide!              

521
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:43,072
    Marcus! Why would you--?    
  That's just not smart, man.   

522
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,145
               You tell Theresa,
               I'll kill you.   

523
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,586
Bimbo's next.                   

524
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:00,123
       Oh, God. Not that.       
         Not the bimbo.         

525
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:04,160
   Let's hurry this shit up.    

526
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,871
             Shit.              

527
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,441
     We got a big problem.      
   We got a big, big problem.   

528
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,075
      Drive that ambulance      
  into the building right now.  

529
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,110
     <i> Crash that ambulance</i>      
      <i> into the building!</i>       

530
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,379
     No, no. Not me, baby.      

531
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,381
     I got too many crashes     
     on my file. You do it.     

532
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,483
No, no, man.                    
You're kidding.                 

533
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,151
I got red-flagged by            
administration last month       

534
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,252
for the thing, you know?        

535
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,854
You know how much the city      
had to pay for that.            

536
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,456
I can't have another            
ding on my file.                

537
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:37,561
    Mike, my man, we want to    
  help you out here, you know,  

538
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,262
      but we got a couple       
   of administration problems   

539
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,597
      over here, you know       
    what I'm talking about,     

540
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,798
    so how about we give you    

541
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,299
<i> sirens and</i>                     
<i> some flashing lights?</i>          

542
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,768
   Make a racket. How's that?   

543
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,771
      Negative! Negative!       

544
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,673
      Crash that ambulance      
  into the building right now!  

545
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,642
We want to help the team out    
and everything, but...          

546
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,344
<i> but I'm not getting</i>            
<i> suspended for this.</i>            

547
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,881
        Okay, I plan on         
      whupping y'all asses      

548
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,449
 the second I get out of here.  

549
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,984
      <i> Crash that ambulance into</i>
      <i> the building right now!</i>  

550
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,319
    Screw it. Just the price    
    of cop business, my man.    

551
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,321
   Now, get her on the table.   

552
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:18,201
          Oh, my God.           

553
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,875
What the hell? I'm so-- I'm so--
      That's tragic, man.       

554
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,743
 Go, go, go. Back door's clear. 
            Go! Go!             

555
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,045
        Get up, Marcus!         

556
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,481
       The gas got stuck.       
       I didn't mean to.        

557
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,155
    Oh, man.                    

558
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:46,095
Supple leather, you know?       

559
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,263
You ever rub your leather?      

560
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,533
You know, like, just rub it,    
see how good it feels?          

561
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,440
What does love                  
mean to you, Mike?              

562
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,509
            Don't worry about me
            and my love.        

563
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:05,015
      Look, I got plenty of love
      in my life.               

564
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,516
Like a woman's butt.            

565
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,517
                  Don't do that.

566
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike.         

567
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,288
          Let's just concentrate
          and get this warrant. 

568
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,157
I need to express               
right now...                    

569
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,526
I want you to know,             
if this is our last job,        

570
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,295
I really appreciate you.        
Okay?                           

571
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,697
No, this is not gay shit.       

572
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,066
           This is man shit.    
           You know what I mean?

573
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,969
        And you a beautiful man.
        You know?               

574
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,737
            And when you let    
            the beautiful side--

575
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,540
                       Wh--What?

576
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,908
Look at your pupils.            

577
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,644
           How am I look at     
           my pupil? What, I'm--

578
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,079
Yo, what are you taking?        

579
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,081
Did you take some of that X?    

580
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,449
       Hey, look, give me a hug.

581
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,751
           Hey, get off. Listen,
           listen. Listen!      

582
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,987
           We need this warrant.
           Do not fuck this up. 

583
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,589
Pull yourself together.         

584
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,623
           Arr! Arr!            

585
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,897
Evening, captain.               

586
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,766
Hello...capteeon.               

587
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:00,570
    So, how do you two plan     
 to fuck up my evening tonight? 

588
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,473
   Well, captain, believe me,   
    we would not be here...     

589
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,743
    if it weren't seriously,    
       utterly important.       

590
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,578
          Get in here.          

591
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,414
    Get off me!                 

592
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:24,560
        Ho, ho, ho, Cap,        
       this is beautiful.       

593
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,631
     Have such a warm feel,     
           you know?            

594
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,100
   Sort of like a ving shwa.    
        What's it, Mike?        

595
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,267
       Mike, it was a V,        

596
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,602
               like a von schwo.

597
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,137
   Why don't you have a seat?   

598
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,471
       Or ven wangs, or--       

599
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,607
                      Feng shui.

600
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,942
           Von sway.            

601
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,811
   You have a von sway home.    

602
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,379
     Make yourself at home.     

603
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,914
All right, captain,             

604
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,784
I know you said that            
Johnny Tapia was hands-off...   

605
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,452
but, captain,                   
we got him. It's a wrap.        

606
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,287
Look, we messed up today,       
but we got him.                 

607
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,289
Please just look.               

608
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,357
       How do I move it?        

609
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,293
Here, you can go flip           
through the pictures.           

610
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,395
You can flip--You can           
flip through picture--          

611
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:03,199
       This is horrible.        

612
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,067
                       Mike!    

613
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,971
               Take the picture.

614
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:08,972
You can look                    
really close, Cap.              

615
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,606
Listen, we got everything       
that we need                    

616
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,042
to take this dude.              

617
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,243
          Oh, God. Oh.          

618
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,012
They're taking                  
the organs out.                 

619
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,481
     Right there you can--

01:22:03,412 --> 01:22:04,878
           Casper, drop the bag.

1247
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,147
         Alpha leader,          
         bring them in.         

1248
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:09,683
      ¶ Bad boys, bad boys      
      What you gonna do? ¶      

1249
01:22:09,685 --> 01:22:13,621
      ¶ What you gonna do       
    When we come for you? ¶     

1250
01:22:13,623 --> 01:22:16,890
   ¶ ...nax mez nose na-hey ¶   

1251
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:18,225
Dude, you gotta learn the words.

1252
01:22:18,227 --> 01:22:19,760
 We usually only do the chorus. 

1253
01:22:19,762 --> 01:22:20,761
   Alpha leader, hit it. Br--   

1254
01:22:20,763 --> 01:22:23,264
Repeat your transmission.       

1255
01:22:23,266 --> 01:22:25,932
     Alpha leader to Bravo Four,
     please continue relay.     

1256
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:29,470
        Where's backup?         

1257
01:22:29,472 --> 01:22:30,837
                  Alpha leader, 
                  bring them in.

1258
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:31,838
                         Hit it.

1259
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,006
 Mike, I'm only getting static. 

1260
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:34,808
All I'm getting is static.      
These radios are fucked.        

1261
01:22:36,212 --> 01:22:37,611
        Something funny?        

1262
01:22:37,613 --> 01:22:38,612
Something funny?                

1263
01:22:38,614 --> 01:22:39,480
     Mike, where are they?      

1264
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,619
        Got you, nigger.        

1265
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:46,953
                           Whoo!

1266
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,722
            [CLICK]             

1267
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:50,991
      Looks like we got us      
       a situation here.        

1268
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:52,293
                 You ain't gonna
                 shoot, nigger. 

1269
01:22:52,295 --> 01:22:53,994
  Just 'cause you got that gun  
     to my partner's head,      

1270
01:22:53,996 --> 01:22:56,029
 you're thinking I ain't gonna  
  splatter your shit all over?  

1271
01:22:56,031 --> 01:22:57,198
That's what I'm thinking.       

1272
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,532
 See, what you don't understand 

1273
01:22:58,534 --> 01:23:00,234
is my partner came here tonight 
        prepared to die.        

1274
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:01,569
        Hell--Hell, no!         

1275
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:02,869
  Incinerating trash like you.  

1276
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:04,305
              You ready to die, 
              ain't you, Marcus?

1277
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:05,839
The fuck I want to do that for? 

1278
01:23:05,841 --> 01:23:06,907
    Scared, ain't you, boy?     

1279
01:23:06,909 --> 01:23:08,342
              A, You can        
              put that gun down,

1280
01:23:08,344 --> 01:23:09,743
     tell me who's bringing     
         this shit in,          

1281
01:23:09,745 --> 01:23:11,545
      and maybe I'll just       
   pop one in your shoulder,    

1282
01:23:11,547 --> 01:23:13,247
   or B, you can keep acting    
           all Brody,           

1283
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:15,082
   and I'm going to plant one   
        in your chest...        

1284
01:23:15,084 --> 01:23:18,819
 Or C, you know, take the time  
      to talk a minute...       

1285
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:20,721
           you know,            
   de-escalate the situation.   

1286
01:23:20,723 --> 01:23:22,256
      You see, that's some      
     new spiritual bullshit     

1287
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:23,257
        my partner's on.        

1288
01:23:23,259 --> 01:23:24,491
              Me?               

1289
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:26,093
       I actually prefer        
    shooting motherfuckers.     

1290
01:23:26,095 --> 01:23:28,161
  A lot of movement going on.   

1291
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:29,597
       Can't see the UCs.       

1292
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:30,731
            <i> I think something's</i>
            <i> going down.</i>        

1293
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,165
Don't move yet.                 

1294
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:34,668
         Mike, the man          
     has a gun to my head.      

1295
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,736
    I bet he'll put it down     

1296
01:23:35,738 --> 01:23:37,204
    if I put a hollow point     
          in his eye.           

1297
01:23:37,206 --> 01:23:39,840
                 Your partner's 
                 a cocky nigger.

1298
01:23:39,842 --> 01:23:41,575
 Damn. Now, was that necessary, 
              sir?              

1299
01:23:41,577 --> 01:23:42,576
              See?              

1300
01:23:42,578 --> 01:23:43,877
How come he can't just be a cop?

1301
01:23:43,879 --> 01:23:45,078
   He got to be a nigga too?    

1302
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,347
       I'm gonna go ahead       
       and hot this fool.       

1303
01:23:46,349 --> 01:23:47,348
     Mike, look, calm down.     

1304
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,149
Calm down? I'm calm.            

1305
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:52,453
I'm calm! Hey! Whoa! Whoa!      

1306
01:23:52,455 --> 01:23:54,855
           I am way too unstable
           for that bullshit.   

1307
01:23:54,857 --> 01:23:56,690
            Stop all the goddamn
            movement!           

1308
01:23:56,692 --> 01:23:58,459
     Everybody stop moving!     

1309
01:23:58,461 --> 01:23:59,760
    We can't let you all go,    

1310
01:23:59,762 --> 01:24:01,562
     but look, this shit'll     
    get worked out in court.    

1311
01:24:01,564 --> 01:24:03,764
       We got our rights.       

1312
01:24:03,766 --> 01:24:05,065
Why don't you                   
exercise your right             

1313
01:24:05,067 --> 01:24:06,066
to shut the fuck up?            

1314
01:24:06,068 --> 01:24:07,234
         I'm all right.         

1315
01:24:07,236 --> 01:24:09,102
         I'm just going         
  to give you a warning, okay?  

1316
01:24:09,104 --> 01:24:11,938
That's the best I can fucking do
       for all of youse!        

1317
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,574
       Okay? He's crazy.        

1318
01:24:13,576 --> 01:24:15,242
     You got three seconds      
   to put your gun down, sir.   

1319
01:24:15,244 --> 01:24:17,645
        He has emotional        
     anger issue problems!      

1320
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:18,646
              One.              

1321
01:24:18,648 --> 01:24:20,247
He goes to bed early            
for this shit!                  

1322
01:24:20,249 --> 01:24:22,716
Just to wake up to pop one      
in a motherfucker!              

1323
01:24:22,718 --> 01:24:23,617
               Two!             
Mike, no!                       

1324
01:24:24,654 --> 01:24:25,753
     Gun!                       

1325
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:30,391
    Rock 'n' roll! Let's go!    

1326
01:24:30,393 --> 01:24:31,759
        Kill them cops!         

1327
01:25:03,693 --> 01:25:05,091
            Marcus!             

1328
01:25:40,563 --> 01:25:42,796
  Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, go!  

1329
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:47,401
           Get down!            

1330
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:50,170
          Drop the--!           

1331
01:25:52,307 --> 01:25:53,841
       I didn't do shit!        

1332
01:25:53,843 --> 01:25:55,576
              Get your hands up.

1333
01:25:55,578 --> 01:25:57,811
The radios were fucked up.      
Get some medics over here.      

1334
01:25:57,813 --> 01:25:58,812
You guys okay?                  

1335
01:25:58,814 --> 01:26:00,381
               Yeah, we're fine.

1336
01:26:00,383 --> 01:26:01,382
      What you mean, "we"?      

1337
01:26:01,384 --> 01:26:03,049
Motherfucker shot me            
in the ass, man.                

1338
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:07,220
    Who shot you in the ass?    

1339
01:26:07,222 --> 01:26:08,255
 Who? That "who" would be you.  

1340
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:09,423
        Me? I shot you?         

1341
01:26:09,425 --> 01:26:10,524
             Yeah.              

1342
01:26:10,526 --> 01:26:11,958
    I mean, I was shooting.     

1343
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,561
 Yeah, I did a lot of shooting, 

1344
01:26:14,563 --> 01:26:17,163
       but I ain't saying       
     I shot you in the ass.     

1345
01:26:17,165 --> 01:26:19,900
     I mean, I ain't saying     
     I didn't shoot you...      

1346
01:26:19,902 --> 01:26:23,504
            but, damn! Somebody 
            shot you in the ass.

1347
01:26:23,506 --> 01:26:24,738
       Tell me about it.        

1348
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,206
                  Yo, man,      
                  how's it feel?

1349
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:28,174
         It's hot, man.         
  I can smell my ass burning.   

1350
01:26:28,176 --> 01:26:30,577
Yo, Mike, why don't you just    
give it a little kiss, man,     

1351
01:26:30,579 --> 01:26:32,579
you know,                       
so it'll feel better?           

1352
01:26:32,581 --> 01:26:34,381
     Hey, just pretend like     
   we're not even here, man.    

1353
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:36,417
    Hey, isn't Ricky Martin     
       having a concert?        

1354
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:37,418
        Get the fuck on.        

1355
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,085
You always gotta                
go racial, man.                 

1356
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:40,287
It's sad, man.                  

1357
01:26:41,557 --> 01:26:43,990
I think it's cool, man.         
It hit the meat.                

1358
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:45,292
It ain't nowhere                
near the hole.                  

1359
01:26:47,763 --> 01:26:49,496
        Two lousy bags?         

1360
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:51,298
     What ever happened to      
the biggest shipment of ecstasy 

1361
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,266
 to ever come out of Amsterdam? 

1362
01:26:53,268 --> 01:26:55,135
           Let me worry about   
           my snitch, all right?

1363
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:57,671
It's a lot of cop work          
for nothing!                    

1364
01:26:57,673 --> 01:26:59,272
                 Take your ass  
                 home somewhere.

1365
01:27:07,149 --> 01:27:09,983
       Tonight<i> la policia</i>       
         jacked my mules.       

1366
01:27:09,985 --> 01:27:11,652
        Who in this room        
        full of my<i> manos</i>        

1367
01:27:11,654 --> 01:27:15,322
 can tell me how those jackals  
knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?

1368
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:18,091
       Speak up, cousins.       

1369
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:20,794
You're lucky they did not       
find my drugs on<i> Dixie 7.</i>       

1370
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:22,796

You remember?                   

1549

                       Oh, um...

1550
01:35:44,799 --> 01:35:46,632
The two of you                  
should've gotten together.      

1551
01:35:46,634 --> 01:35:47,767
That would've been              
really nice.                    

1552
01:35:47,769 --> 01:35:48,969
             Yeah.              

1553
01:35:48,971 --> 01:35:50,903

     Mike was in New York.

what, another week?             

1556
01:35:56,778 --> 01:35:58,711
Why don't you show her          
around Miami?                   

1557
01:35:58,713 --> 01:35:59,712
That'd be nice.

1566
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:22,168
That ain't exactly a pool, man.

       Okay, so how much        
    do the good pools cost?     

1572
01:36:33,882 --> 01:36:34,881
           It's all right, baby.

1573

01:48:16,968 --> 01:48:17,967
                     You, drive!

1741
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:26,676
              Go!               

1742
01:48:35,619 --> 01:48:37,352
Go, go, go, Mike!               
Punch that shit! Punch it!      

1743
01:49:11,522 --> 01:49:12,387
             Shit!              

1744
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:19,195
          Move! Move!           

1745
01:49:24,401 --> 01:49:25,500
Don't lose her, Mike!           

1746
01:49:25,502 --> 01:49:27,369
       This is what I do!       

1747
01:49:43,554 --> 01:49:45,755
        Aw, shit! Shit.         

1748
01:49:45,757 --> 01:49:47,857
      And definitely shoot

        What are you doing, man?

1752
01:50:07,411 --> 01:50:08,543
         That's my bad.         

1753
01:50:08,545 --> 01:50:09,745
         Shoot outside!         

1754
01:50:09,747 --> 01:50:11,580
              Pay attention to  
              what you're doing.

1755
01:50:29,733 --> 01:50:31,267
        Oh, these dudes         
       is off the chain!        

1756
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,145
          Jesus! Fuck!          

1757
01:50:50,154 --> 01:50:51,821
This is some sick shit!         

1758
01:50:51,823 --> 01:50:53,055
              Yep, it's about to
              get sicker.       

1759
01:51:03,835 --> 01:51:04,700
     Watch out! Watch out!      

1760
01:51:07,338 --> 01:51:08,637
           Oh, sh--!            

1761
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:10,306
        Oh, they are not        
       about to do that.        

1762
01:51:10,308 --> 01:51:11,907
      Hell, yes, they are!      

1763
01:51:23,855 --> 01:51:24,854
         You see that?          

1764
01:51:24,856 --> 01:51:25,855
      They throwing cars!

01:51:25,857 --> 01:51:26,722
     How am I not see that?     

1766
01:51:31,695 --> 01:51:33,528
 Mike, I'm just trying to help, 
             okay?              

1767
01:51:33,530 --> 01:51:34,897
    You know what'd be real     
    fucking helpful, Marcus?    

1768
01:51:34,899 --> 01:51:36,465
     Just shut the fuck up      
       and let me drive!        

1769
01:51:36,467 --> 01:51:37,333
        Let's try that!         

1770
01:51:44,842 --> 01:51:46,842
       Hey, come on, man,       
    with the screaming shit!    

1771
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,313
   I'm trying to concentrate    
on dodging these motherfuckers. 

1772
01:51:58,189 --> 01:51:59,054
          Just relax.           

1773
01:52:06,163 --> 01:52:08,197
   That motherfucker flipped!   

1774
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:09,664
            That one            
    puckered up my butthole.    

1775
01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:11,566
Almost fucking crushed my head. 

1776
01:52:31,355 --> 01:52:32,221
           The boat!            

1777
01:52:48,406 --> 01:52:49,271
             Whoo!              

1778
01:52:55,779 --> 01:52:57,379
          I lost them.          

1779
01:52:57,381 --> 01:52:59,048
   Yeah, I've got your cargo    
   to the backup drop point.

1783
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,268
         What the fuck          
       is going on, Syd?        

1784
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,303
                 Some desk

 Get over here. I'm undercover. 
 And please call off your dogs.

  I got DEA watching my back,   
     so don't blow my case.

      We saved your life.       

1788
01:53:28,912 --> 01:53:30,346
  Yeah, and I appreciate that,  

1789
01:53:30,348 --> 01:53:33,548
 but what I don't appreciate is 
you two following me over here, 

1790
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:35,284
     nearly burning a case      
that took five months to set up.

1791
01:53:35,286 --> 01:53:37,453
                  So now we lie 
                  to each other?

1792
01:53:37,455 --> 01:53:38,988
             Is that what we do?

1793
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:40,155
What do you want me             
to do, Marcus?                  

1794
01:53:40,157 --> 01:53:41,223
All right, y'all.               

1795
01:53:41,225 --> 01:53:42,358
 Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong.  

1796
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,226
Calm down. Relax.               

1797
01:53:44,228 --> 01:53:46,428
Syd, are there drugs            
in that truck?                  

1798
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:47,429
         There's cash.          

1799
01:53:47,431 --> 01:53:48,430
Where's it going?               

1800
01:53:48,432 --> 01:53:49,898
     I can't tell you that.     

1801
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:51,100
                        Why not?

1802
01:53:51,102 --> 01:53:52,468
    Because I have a career,    

1803
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:54,336
   and if I want to keep it,    
    I have rules to follow.     

1804
01:53:54,338 --> 01:53:55,604
               What's that      
               supposed to mean?

1805
01:53:55,606 --> 01:53:57,139
  It means that my orders are   

1806
01:53:57,141 --> 01:53:59,341
     under no circumstances     
share information with Miami PD,

1807
01:53:59,343 --> 01:54:00,675
        because they got        
        too many leaks.         

1808
01:54:00,677 --> 01:54:03,278
           Oh. I'm Miami PD now?

1809
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,014
          You done forgot I'm   
          your big brother, huh?

1810
01:54:05,016 --> 01:54:06,281
             You know what, Syd?

1811
01:54:06,283 --> 01:54:08,117
               That shit you did
               was reckless,    

1812
01:54:08,119 --> 01:54:11,120
           it was stupid, and it
           was dangerous. Okay? 

1813
01:54:11,122 --> 01:54:13,322
        I'm telling Mommy. Okay?

1814
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:15,624
              I'm definitely    
              leaking that shit.

1815
01:54:15,626 --> 01:54:17,292
         Hey, Marcus...         

1816
01:54:19,796 --> 01:54:21,163
                 Syd, come on,  
                 he got a point.

1817
01:54:21,165 --> 01:54:23,298
         Your brother loves you.

1818
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,733
              And not to mention
              a little thing    

1819
01:54:24,735 --> 01:54:26,268
          called                
          professional courtesy.

1820
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:28,070
         You bouncing around    
         in somebody's backyard,

1821
01:54:28,072 --> 01:54:30,772
       you should maybe let them
       know about it.           

1822
01:54:35,779 --> 01:54:38,380
                 First time     
                 using your gun?

1823
01:54:38,382 --> 01:54:41,116
             Hey, you handled   
             yourself very well.

1824
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:43,385
Too bad your partner            
didn't notice.                  

1825
01:54:44,888 --> 01:54:46,455
            Thanks.             

1826
01:54:46,457 --> 01:54:48,023
          What, you think       
          you get off that easy?

1827
01:54:48,025 --> 01:54:49,724
        You been working on this
        for five months?        

1828
01:54:49,726 --> 01:54:51,560
        You ain't tell me       
        while I was in New York?

1829
01:54:51,562 --> 01:54:52,794
And what would you              
have said?                      

1830
01:54:52,796 --> 01:54:53,895
              What? I would've--

1831
01:54:53,897 --> 01:54:54,896
              You know, I'd have
              let you know      

1832
01:54:54,898 --> 01:54:56,331
             this job is rugged,
             you know?          

1833
01:54:56,333 --> 01:54:57,533
             And it's dangerous,

1834
01:54:57,535 --> 01:54:59,234
         and if something happen
         to you, I might...     

1835
01:54:59,236 --> 01:55:02,504
      Exactly why I didn't      
         say anything.          

1836
01:55:10,347 --> 01:55:11,313
            Somebody's          
            stealing your money.

1837
01:55:14,918 --> 01:55:18,287
  The drop's done. I gotta go.  

1838
01:55:22,693 --> 01:55:23,692
            Thanks.             

1839
01:55:42,179 --> 01:55:44,913
       We gotta close this case 
       before it get her killed.

1840
01:55:44,915 --> 01:55:46,881

02:02:01,458 --> 02:02:03,825
           and became           
 a overcompensating tough guy.  

1990
02:02:05,662 --> 02:02:07,295
That is the last time           

1991
02:02:07,297 --> 02:02:10,264
you will ever                   
refer to my mother's titties.   

1992
02:02:10,266 --> 02:02:15,504
          I don't even want them
          up in your head.      

1993
02:02:15,506 --> 02:02:20,341
You know, I said all that, Mike,
and all you heard was "titties."

1994
02:02:20,343 --> 02:02:23,578
Man, you can't keep suppressing 
   my spiritual growth, Mike.   

1995
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:25,113
You need to suppress            
my mother's titties             

1996
02:02:25,115 --> 02:02:26,648
out of                          
your psychoanalysis.            

1997
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:28,583
           You just remember    
           one thing, my friend.

1998
02:02:28,585 --> 02:02:30,986
                I may not always
                be here.        

1999
02:02:33,957 --> 02:02:36,791
             What's up, Icepick?

2000
02:02:36,793 --> 02:02:38,459
Jesus is the way,               
my brothers.                    

2001
02:02:38,461 --> 02:02:39,828
Step inside.                    

2002
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:42,564
You just went number one        
on Uncle Mike's shit list.      

2003
02:02:42,566 --> 02:02:44,332
             We got             
      two lousy bags, man.      

2004
02:02:44,334 --> 02:02:45,366
                    My brothers.

2005
02:02:45,368 --> 02:02:47,636
Haitian blond with dreads.      
Where is he?                    

2006
02:02:47,638 --> 02:02:53,141
           Blondie Dread? Uh-uh.
           He's very expensive. 

2007
02:02:53,143 --> 02:02:57,045
            You and you have to 
            do something for me.

2008
02:02:57,047 --> 02:03:00,114
 Oh, you trying to get gangsta  
        on me like that?        

2009
02:03:00,116 --> 02:03:01,115
Yeah, he went gangsta.          

2010
02:03:01,117 --> 02:03:02,116
         So we should probably--

2011
02:03:02,118 --> 02:03:03,518
So we want to do the--          

2012
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:04,986
Yeah, sure.                     

2013
02:03:04,988 --> 02:03:08,957
  Me and my partner, we're on   
the Miami PD tandem dance team. 

2014
02:03:08,959 --> 02:03:10,425
               We got a routine.

2015
02:03:10,427 --> 02:03:11,726
            We won all the local
            talent shows.       

2016
02:03:11,728 --> 02:03:13,327
               We thinking about
               going national.  

2017
02:03:13,329 --> 02:03:14,663
            You want to show him
            some of the routine?

2018
02:03:15,866 --> 02:03:19,734
             Ooh, warm it up.   
             Don't hurt nothing.

2019
02:03:19,736 --> 02:03:21,202
Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this. 

2020
02:03:21,204 --> 02:03:22,671
   This the shit right here.    
       This is the shit.        

2021

      It's your birthday ¶      

2022
02:03:26,209 --> 02:03:27,709
     ¶ It's your birthday ¶     

2023
02:03:31,982 --> 02:03:33,314
                What you doing  
                to my shop, man?

2024
02:03:33,316 --> 02:03:34,749
        Watch this spin.        

2025
02:03:34,751 --> 02:03:35,884
                       Wait.    

2026
02:03:38,488 --> 02:03:40,321
             What are you doing?

2027
02:03:40,323 --> 02:03:41,656
               Oh, give me some.

2028
02:03:41,658 --> 02:03:43,058
 You're ruining my shop. Stop!  

2029
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:45,293
Do the dance thing.             

2030
02:03:45,295 --> 02:03:46,427
I'm gonna bring the house down. 

2031
02:03:46,429 --> 02:03:47,729
                         No! No!

2032
02:03:53,136 --> 02:03:54,569
                           Stop!

     eight blocks from here     

2034

       Police! Get down.        

2036
02:04:07,784 --> 02:04:09,784
Police!                         

2037
02:04:44,254 --> 02:04:46,821
   Who that? Who in my house?   

2038
02:04:46,823 --> 02:04:48,757
  I'm the devil. Who's asking?  

2039
02:04:48,759 --> 02:04:51,159
 The devil is not welcome here! 

2040
02:04:51,161 --> 02:04:54,129
    You got to call yourself    
 the devil in his house? Shit!  

2041
02:04:55,799 --> 02:04:57,532
             You're in my house!

2042
02:04:57,534 --> 02:04:59,934
This is all your fault!         

2043
02:04:59,936 --> 02:05:01,469
 You're in my country, though.

02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:02,603
           Fuck you, how's that?

        You no problem!         

2049
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,447
    Mike, do you have to be     
         so combative?

        Do or die, man!         

2054
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:25,994
    A bullet in the head'll     
really mess up your extensions. 

2055
02:05:25,996 --> 02:05:27,628
         Take your bullet       
         and eat that shit, man.

2056
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:28,629

   Sir, we just want to talk.

   Well, go ahead. Go ahead.

  They can't hear you because   
 they're still shooting at you.

02:08:49,866 --> 02:08:51,665
   Oh, he don't know nothing.   

2114
02:08:51,667 --> 02:08:54,235
           His brains           
    is under the end table.     

2115
02:08:54,237 --> 02:08:57,505
            Oh. Sh--            

2116
02:08:57,507 --> 02:08:59,307
  He can't tell us shit, Mike.  

2117
02:08:59,309 --> 02:09:00,708
      He's all fucked up.       

2118
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:01,742
       What's your point?       

2119
02:09:01,744 --> 02:09:04,412
 Dead suspects can't say shit.  

2120
02:09:04,414 --> 02:09:05,780
      Well, it seems like       
         live suspects          

2121
02:09:05,782 --> 02:09:07,048
     don't say shit either,     

2122
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:08,682
     so I'm gonna go ahead      
    and hot this dude here.     

2123
02:09:08,684 --> 02:09:09,850
     Save us the paperwork.     

2124
02:09:09,852 --> 02:09:10,985
I don't know nothing!           

2125
02:09:10,987 --> 02:09:13,421
I don't do motherfucking        
surveillance, man.              

2126
02:09:13,423 --> 02:09:14,688
He do surveillance,             
man.                            

2127
02:09:14,690 --> 02:09:16,690
He don't let nobody             
touch his camera.               

2128
02:09:18,261 --> 02:09:19,693
What's on that camera?          

2129
02:09:19,695 --> 02:09:23,298
Trigger Mike strikes again.     

2130
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,933
     Hi, welcome to Phat's.     
      How can I help you?       

2131
02:09:24,935 --> 02:09:26,534
                       Miami PD.

2132
02:09:26,536 --> 02:09:28,169
          Whoa. Cops.           
       I love that show.        

2133
02:09:28,171 --> 02:09:29,603
           We need to see what's
           on this videotape.   

2134
02:09:29,605 --> 02:09:31,105
          Absolutely.           

2135
02:09:31,107 --> 02:09:32,840
        You got a little        
     bullet hole in there.      

2136
02:09:32,842 --> 02:09:35,243
   You guys tell me about it?   

2137
02:09:35,245 --> 02:09:36,811
  Guess not. Okay. All right.   

2138
02:09:36,813 --> 02:09:38,112
      Okay, we'll put this      
  in our central floor model.   

2139
02:09:38,114 --> 02:09:40,048
    It's got kick-ass bass.     
  You guys like hip-hop music?  

2140
02:09:40,050 --> 02:09:41,182
        I love hip-hop.         

2141
02:09:41,184 --> 02:09:42,550
     Sometimes we freestyle     
       in the break room.       

2142
02:09:42,552 --> 02:09:44,919
     If you guys ever want      
    to kick it, we'll flow.     

2143
02:09:44,921 --> 02:09:46,921
     All right, we're gonna     
 set you up on the wide-screen. 

2144
02:09:46,923 --> 02:09:48,589
        Correct ratio...        

2145
02:09:52,795 --> 02:09:56,230
         Spanish Palms Mortuary.

2146
02:09:56,232 --> 02:09:58,232
         Why would they         
     be doing surveillance      

2147
02:09:58,234 --> 02:10:00,201
       at a funeral home?       

2148
02:10:00,203 --> 02:10:01,602
Is that a Cuban flag?           

2149
02:10:01,604 --> 02:10:03,438
           Uh, uh...right there.
           See the gun?         

2150
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,440
           Never knew           
  the guards at funeral homes   

2151
02:10:05,442 --> 02:10:06,740
        needed to carry         
     them kind of weapons.      

2152
02:10:11,081 --> 02:10:12,213
              It just seems like

2153
02:10:12,215 --> 02:10:13,281
          we should turn it off,
          you know,             

2154
02:10:13,283 --> 02:10:14,915
 because my dad owns the store. 

2155
02:10:14,917 --> 02:10:16,584
     She got a tongue ring.     

2156
02:10:18,754 --> 02:10:20,254
     This is like a porno.      
          We're not--           

2157
02:10:20,256 --> 02:10:22,256
                     Dude. Dude.
                     All right? 

2158
02:10:22,258 --> 02:10:23,124
             Yeah.              

2159
02:10:24,494 --> 02:10:26,461
          Okay. Okay.           

2160
02:10:26,463 --> 02:10:27,628
      It's just, you know,      
      my dad's gonna be--       

2161
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:28,762
  I just need to--I think I--   

2162
02:10:28,764 --> 02:10:32,800
           [MOANING]            

2163
02:10:40,276 --> 02:10:43,011
This is official                
police business.                

2164
02:10:43,013 --> 02:10:45,413
                 What the fuck's
                 going on here? 

2165
02:10:45,415 --> 02:10:46,747
         Out of my way.         

2166
02:10:46,749 --> 02:10:48,816
               My dad is coming.
               My dad is coming.

2167
02:10:48,818 --> 02:10:51,285
   What the hell is going on    
          in my store?          

2168
02:10:51,287 --> 02:10:55,923
  Son, how did this porno crap  
 get on my videos in my store?  

2169
02:10:55,925 --> 02:10:57,925
What the hell is                
going on in here?               

2170
02:11:01,097 --> 02:11:02,363
         You all right?         

2171
02:11:02,365 --> 02:11:04,499
                No, I'm not     
                all right, Mike.

2172
02:11:04,501 --> 02:11:06,434
                   Three days   
                   of this shit.

2173
02:11:06,436 --> 02:11:08,102
                   Got my nerves
                   all rattled. 

2174
02:11:12,075 --> 02:11:13,874
     My ass still hurts...      

2175
02:11:13,876 --> 02:11:17,711
        <i> from what you did to it</i>
        <i> the other night.</i>       

2176
02:11:17,713 --> 02:11:19,113
    Oh, my Lord.                

2177
02:11:19,115 --> 02:11:23,617
Yeah, it got rough.             
You know?                       

2178
02:11:23,619 --> 02:11:27,321
    I mean, we got caught up    
 in the moment, shit got crazy. 

2179
02:11:27,323 --> 02:11:28,222
      You know how I get.       

2180
02:11:30,793 --> 02:11:33,161
<i> When you popped me from behind,</i>

2181
02:11:33,163 --> 02:11:35,029
            <i> I think</i>            
   <i> you damaged some nerves.</i>    

2182
02:11:35,031 --> 02:11:36,497
             Okay.              

2183
02:11:36,499 --> 02:11:38,066
                   Now I can't--

2184
02:11:41,171 --> 02:11:43,071
                 Now I can't... 

2185
02:11:43,073 --> 02:11:44,072
          Can't what?           

2186
02:11:44,074 --> 02:11:46,807
 I can't even get an erection.  

2187
02:11:46,809 --> 02:11:48,909
             What's an erection?

2188
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:53,381
I tried taking Viagra, you know,
       pop one, pop two.        

2189
02:11:53,383 --> 02:11:55,015
Been eating them like Skittles. 

2190
02:11:55,017 --> 02:11:57,851
          That poor man is      
          pouring out his heart.

2191
02:11:57,853 --> 02:11:59,820
     And I'm still flaccid.     

2192
02:11:59,822 --> 02:12:01,755
           Um, okay.            

2193
02:12:01,757 --> 02:12:03,724
I'm comfortable                 
talking to you...               

2194
02:12:03,726 --> 02:12:06,394
      It's got 5.1 Dolby.       

2195
02:12:06,396 --> 02:12:09,263
   MIKE:<i> ...about what I did</i>    
        <i> to your ass...</i>         

2196
02:12:09,265 --> 02:12:13,401
but you not getting             
an erection...                  

2197
02:12:13,403 --> 02:12:15,336
that's a real problem           
for me.                         

2198
02:12:15,338 --> 02:12:17,438
         I just figured         
      I could talk to you.      

2199
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:19,773
Yeah, yeah, no, no.             
We're partners,                 

2200
02:12:19,775 --> 02:12:22,510
      but we are partners       
        with boundaries.        

2201
02:12:22,512 --> 02:12:25,346
We got a new rule.              

2202
02:12:25,348 --> 02:12:29,250
From now on, you can't say      
the word "flaccid" to me.       

2203
02:12:29,252 --> 02:12:31,252
He's a mean fuck.               

2204
02:12:31,254 --> 02:12:33,687
           Look here.           
This is our little boundary box.

2205
02:12:33,689 --> 02:12:35,756
So we gonna take                
the word "flaccid,"             

2206
02:12:35,758 --> 02:12:39,460
and we're gonna put it in there 
    with my mom's titties...    

2207
02:12:39,462 --> 02:12:40,661
with your erection problems,    

2208
02:12:40,663 --> 02:12:42,130
and we're gonna                 
close this box...               

2209
02:12:42,132 --> 02:12:44,398
and we're gonna throw this bitch
         in the ocean,          

2210
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:47,735
 and the only way that you can  
        get to this box         

2211
02:12:47,737 --> 02:12:50,037
 is you got to be motherfucking 
       Jacques Cousteau.        

2212
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:51,606
We cool?                        

2213
02:12:56,979 --> 02:12:58,613
    Naw.                        

2214
02:13:00,082 --> 02:13:04,084
                    Oh, shit.   
                    We gotta go.

2215
02:13:04,086 --> 02:13:05,453
     In front of my babies      

2216
02:13:05,455 --> 02:13:07,855
         you got porno          
   and homo shows up in here?   

2217
02:13:07,857 --> 02:13:08,789
  What kind of freak-ass store  
            is this?            

2218
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:14,362
   And you two motherfuckers    
          need Jesus.           

2219
02:13:14,364 --> 02:13:15,429
     Cover your ears, baby.     

2220
02:13:17,433 --> 02:13:19,467
    Palm Mortuary, owned by     
  an offshore holding company,  

2221
02:13:19,469 --> 02:13:21,435
     which, after 17 layers     
          of bullshit,          

2222
02:13:21,437 --> 02:13:25,406
   turns out to be registered   
     to Donna Maria Tapia,      

2223
02:13:25,408 --> 02:13:26,774
             mother             
  of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,  

2224
02:13:26,776 --> 02:13:29,243
who calls himself               
"Johnny."                       

2225
02:13:29,245 --> 02:13:31,145
      Johnny Tapia. Shit.       

2226
02:13:31,147 --> 02:13:32,813
Looks like every time           
the PD goes after him,          

2227
02:13:32,815 --> 02:13:36,984
  he sues for wrongful arrest.  
     And, oh, does he win.      

2228
02:13:36,986 --> 02:13:39,554
        Look. Last year         
   he was awarded $9 million,   

2229
02:13:39,556 --> 02:13:41,455
        and got a dozen         
   dumb-ass officers like you   

2230
02:13:41,457 --> 02:13:42,823
             fired.             

2231
02:13:42,825 --> 02:13:45,092
              Well, he hasn't   
              run across us yet.

2232
02:13:45,094 --> 02:13:47,595
You know, we'd sure like to hear
 what's going on in that house. 

2233
02:13:47,597 --> 02:13:50,198
 Yeah, use your computer brain  
       and tap the phone.

2599
02:30:44,746 --> 02:30:45,745
      with no convictions.      

2600
02:30:45,747 --> 02:30:47,480
Why don't you guys              
just hang back                  

2601
02:30:47,482 --> 02:30:48,615
and let us                      
bring him down?                 

2602
02:30:48,617 --> 02:30:50,217
 Guys, look, I need this, okay, 

2603
02:30:50,219 --> 02:30:51,818
      and I am this close.      

2604
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,019
      What's "this close"?      

2605
02:30:53,021 --> 02:30:54,787
         I'm in charge          
      of money laundering       

2606
02:30:54,789 --> 02:30:56,089
   for his entire operation.    

2607
02:30:56,091 --> 02:30:58,258
In a month or two we'll have    
enough for a conviction,        

2608
02:30:58,260 --> 02:30:59,759
and this whole thing            
will be over with.              

2609
02:30:59,761 --> 02:31:01,494
    What about a day or two?    
         Sound better?          

2610
02:31:01,496 --> 02:31:03,697
Marcus and I                    
think we found the key          

2611
02:31:03,699 --> 02:31:05,865
                to Tapia's      
                whole operation.

2612
02:31:05,867 --> 02:31:07,834
    You have nothing to say     
  now, huh? Just stuck, right?  

2613
02:31:07,836 --> 02:31:09,269
                         Okay...

2614
02:31:09,271 --> 02:31:11,137
     time out, y'all. Damn!     

2615
02:31:11,139 --> 02:31:12,639
We got this peckerwood          
that's going to put us down     

2616
02:31:12,641 --> 02:31:14,941
with the transport end          
of Tapia's operation.           

2617
02:31:14,943 --> 02:31:15,942
Do you want in?                 

2618
02:31:15,944 --> 02:31:16,943
     Mike, why would you--      

2619
02:31:16,945 --> 02:31:18,044
             When?              

2620
02:31:18,046 --> 02:31:19,312
                        Tonight.

2621
02:31:19,314 --> 02:31:20,913
            Page me.            
    Should I bring my thong?    

2622
02:31:23,985 --> 02:31:28,355
   Get your bitch hands off!    
  I'll knock you the fuck out!  

2623
02:31:28,357 --> 02:31:31,524
      Mike, we're trying to keep
      her out of trouble, man,  

2624
02:31:31,526 --> 02:31:33,593
       not invite her in.       

2625
02:31:33,595 --> 02:31:35,228
              Man, I just       
              figured, you know,

2626
02:31:35,230 --> 02:31:36,396
                 if she with us,

2627
02:31:36,398 --> 02:31:39,832
        that's just less trouble
        she could get into.     

2628
02:31:39,834 --> 02:31:42,034
         I'm going to keep it   
         real with you too, man.

2629
02:31:42,036 --> 02:31:43,570
                 I think she can
                 handle herself.

2630
02:31:43,572 --> 02:31:45,204
I'm going to keep it            
real with you.                  

2631
02:31:45,206 --> 02:31:46,205
Don't nobody                    
know my sister                  

2632
02:31:46,207 --> 02:31:48,141
the way I do, okay?             

2633
02:31:48,143 --> 02:31:50,577
She doesn't                     
make good choices, Mike.        

2634
02:31:50,579 --> 02:31:52,379
She's not                       
street -smart.                  

2635
02:31:52,381 --> 02:31:53,380
             Doesn't make good--

2636
02:31:53,382 --> 02:31:54,381
                 Like, what kind
                 of choices?    

2637
02:31:54,383 --> 02:31:55,915
         Men, for one.          

2638
02:31:55,917 --> 02:31:58,851
She's attracted                 
to these dumb,                  

2639
02:31:58,853 --> 02:32:03,490
    flashy, just musclebound    
   dickheads, Mike, you know?   

2640
02:32:03,492 --> 02:32:06,459
   Cock diesel motherfuckers    
  that can't even fucking turn  

2641
02:32:06,461 --> 02:32:09,696
to wipe                         
their ass, Mike.                

2642
02:32:09,698 --> 02:32:10,730
You feel me?                    

2643
02:32:10,732 --> 02:32:11,931
                       Yeah.    

2644
02:32:11,933 --> 02:32:12,932
You know?                       

2645
02:32:12,934 --> 02:32:14,768
Just dumb as a bucket of shrimp.

2646
02:32:14,770 --> 02:32:19,506
 Yeah. Yeah, that shit's crazy. 

2647
02:32:19,508 --> 02:32:21,174
    I mean, you don't think     
          maybe you--           

2648
02:32:21,176 --> 02:32:22,875
                   maybe you    
                   didn't, like,

2649
02:32:22,877 --> 02:32:24,277
      get a chance to know      
          any of them?          

2650
02:32:24,279 --> 02:32:25,812
       I'm going to give        
     the next one a chance.     

2651
02:32:25,814 --> 02:32:29,649
A chance                        
to whup his ass.                

2652
02:32:29,651 --> 02:32:31,685
Whup the shit                   
out of him.                     

2653
02:32:31,687 --> 02:32:33,286
  Oh, you going to fight him?   

2654
02:32:33,288 --> 02:32:34,421
What I'm going to do            

2655
02:32:34,423 --> 02:32:36,523
ain't even going                
to be legal.                    

2656
02:32:36,525 --> 02:32:39,492
I might be up in here           
with these motherfuckers.       

2657
02:32:39,494 --> 02:32:42,729
Do you know what I mean?        

2658
02:32:42,731 --> 02:32:43,996
The fuck you looking at?        

2659
02:32:43,998 --> 02:32:46,700
       Thank you kindly.        

2660
02:32:46,702 --> 02:32:48,034
         Who sprung me?         

2661
02:32:48,036 --> 02:32:49,336
Hey, Cousin Floyd.              

2662
02:32:49,338 --> 02:32:50,337
            Oh, you.            

2663
02:32:50,339 --> 02:32:51,204
Remember me?                    

2664
02:32:55,410 --> 02:32:57,910
                         Cheese.

2665
02:32:57,912 --> 02:32:59,412
   Y'all look great together.   

2666
02:32:59,414 --> 02:33:00,814
What the fuck                   
you doing?                      

2667
02:33:00,816 --> 02:33:02,181
          Oh, no, just          
      a little insurance.       

2668
02:33:02,183 --> 02:33:03,616
   You going to help us find    
           <i> Dixie 7,</i>            

2669
02:33:03,618 --> 02:33:05,418
 and let us know what that boat 
  has to do with Johnny Tapia.  

2670
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:07,587
       I ain't no snitch.       

2671
02:33:07,589 --> 02:33:12,191
    Oh, you ain't no snitch?    
   Oh, damn. That's a shame.    

2672
02:33:12,193 --> 02:33:13,760
   Know what I'm going to do?   

2673
02:33:13,762 --> 02:33:16,496
       I'm going to send        
        a special 8 x 10        

2674
02:33:16,498 --> 02:33:18,665
to his KKK buddies back in jail.

2675
02:33:18,667 --> 02:33:20,700
         You know what?         
   It's a digital photo too.    

2676
02:33:20,702 --> 02:33:21,768
           So we can pretty much

2677
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:23,670
      do whatever we want       
         to do with it.         

2678
02:33:23,672 --> 02:33:25,271
     Hey, look, by the time     
     we get done with you,      

2679
02:33:25,273 --> 02:33:27,273
    you going be in the next    
   Busta Rhymes video on BET.   

2680
02:33:27,275 --> 02:33:28,842
                       Tuck ass.

2681
02:33:30,579 --> 02:33:32,278
I got my rights.                

2682
02:33:33,882 --> 02:33:35,331
I'm worried.                    

2683
02:33:35,333 --> 02:33:36,932
There's too much heat           
around in Miami.                

2684
02:33:36,934 --> 02:33:40,603
I can feel it.                  
I can feel it.                  

2685
02:33:40,605 --> 02:33:45,174
    We need to put my money     
   in coffins to Cuba faster.   

2686
02:33:45,176 --> 02:33:47,977
  You should tell the mortuary  
 to speed things up. All right? 

2687
02:33:57,155 --> 02:33:58,988
   That's the channel marker    
         way out there.         

2688
02:33:58,990 --> 02:34:02,492
       They make the drop       
        mostly at dawn,         

2689
02:34:02,494 --> 02:34:04,494
   but there'll be one today,   
            though.             

2690
02:34:08,333 --> 02:34:13,869
     Syd, you talk to Mama?     
        She's got hives.        

2691
02:34:13,871 --> 02:34:16,639
      Oh, and I told Mama       
  about your Cubano boyfriend.
