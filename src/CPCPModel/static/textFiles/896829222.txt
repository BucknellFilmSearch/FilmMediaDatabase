    from the pack in some way.

 taking pictures.

      was a little bit...

545
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:45,552
   and that I should            
   go to school.                

546
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:48,438
   I took your advice.          
   I signed up for              
   English classes,             

547
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,707
 and then a year later,         
 I went to community college    

548
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,842
    and I got my                
    Associate's degree,         

549
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,011
    and I'm working on          
    my bachelor's now           
    at Texas State.             

550
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,646
    And also one of             
    the managers here.          

551
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,781
             That's great.      

552
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,682
 It's good to see you,          
 because I really wanted        

553
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,385
   a chance to                  
   thank you for that.          

554
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,922
 <i> Gracias.</i> It really            
  meant a lot to me.            

555
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:10,160
 Don't worry about lunch.       
 It's on me.                    
 It's the least I can do.

She's a smart lady.             

557
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,231
             Thank you.         

558
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,714
 Isn't that kind                
 of crazy, though,              

559
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,281
 that a computer                
 knows who you are              

560
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,084
 from just 20 questions         
 off a form?                    

561
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,388
 I guess there are really       
 only like eight types          
 of people in the world.        

562
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,657
 I mean, there are subsets      
 like male and female,          

563
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,561
 but apparently                 
 we're not as unique            
 as we want to think we are.    

564
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,696
       Have you even            
       talked to this guy yet?  

565
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,150
 No, but we've                  
 been trading emails.           
 He seems pretty cool.          

566
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:53,453
 He's studying                  
 literature and anthropology    

567
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:56,790
and he's way into Bright Eyes,  
so that's not so bad.           

568
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:58,725
 But, anyways,                  
 he was telling me              
 about how                      

569
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:02,529
 the system they use            
 for assigning roommates        
 is kinda spooky.               

570
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:06,666
 The freshman satisfaction      
 rate for new roommates         
 used to be like 60%,           

571
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:10,103
  and now it's 100,             
  just 'cause of the computer.  

572
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:13,990
    Well, sounds like he'll be  
    a good roommate, then.      

573
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,359
 Yeah. But we                   
 pretty much decided            

574
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,695
 that soon they won't even      
 need a questionnaire           

575
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:22,098
       'cause they'll           
       just let the NSA         
       scan your digital ghost  

576
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,134
          and they'll tell you  
          who your roommate is

 you were dyslexic.

661
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:20,740
             to the kids is     
             really rewarding.

   I kind of liked her.         

703

     What'd she say?            

704

    Well, she said that         
    you weren't turning in      
    your homework assignments.  

705
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:23,556

     "I know he does them,

      a big chunk of them       

708

    crumpled up at the bottom   
    of your backpack.

    to turn them in.

    you're still staring out    
    the window all day.

     you destroyed her

    that you crammed            
    a bunch of rocks in it.

    sharpen pencils,            

717

1089

   It was fuckin' huge!

   by Indians in Alaska.        

1142

01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,778
    SAMANTHA: You guys          
    are gonna get us arrested.  

1957
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:05,112
 MASON SR.: Look,               
 I'm a patriot, all right?      

1958
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,815
 And sometimes in this life     
 you gotta fight.               

1959
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:13,821
 And what is it that you do     
 at these parties?              

1960
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,992
 I don't know.                  
 Talk, dance,                   
 listen to music.               

1961
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,395
   Uh-huh. And that's more fun  
   to you than going camping    

1962
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,130
           with your brother    
           and your father      
           who love you.        

1963
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,783
 Yes. Sorry.                    

1964
01:03:25,852 --> 01:03:27,351
         Wow. Is there gonna    
         be alcohol there?      

1965
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:30,154
     Probably not.              

1966
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,573
 Maybe some of the seniors.     
       MASON SR.: Mmm-hmm.      

1967
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,058
   I know what this party is.   

1968
01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:36,527
        The parents are         
        out of town, right?     

1969
01:03:36,596 --> 01:03:38,596
           Somebody's scored    
           a keg, right?        

1970
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:41,265
        You guys are gonna      
        have a good time,       
        trash the whole house.  

1971
01:03:41,334 --> 01:03:42,417
            Right? Am I right?  
            No.                 

1972
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,886
 No, Dad.                       
 Amy's really responsible.      

1973
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,103
                 Mmm-hmm.       

1974
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,823
         Who's gonna be there?  

1975
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:52,443
 Marie, Christine, Amy.         
 Everyone.                      

1976
01:03:52,512 --> 01:03:55,412
         Is that guy on         
         your Facebook page,    
         is he gonna be there?  

1977
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,415
         Who?                   

1978
01:03:57,484 --> 01:04:00,217
           Come on, the guy     
           that's got his arm   
           wrapped around you,  

1979
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,619
           with his hair        
           over his eyes.       

1980
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:02,820
 Garret?                        

1981
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:04,872
             Garret.            
             Is that his name?  
             All right.         

1982
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,008
     Is Garret gonna be there?  

1983
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:08,959
        Probably.               

1984
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:11,045
             Probably. Uh-huh.  
             You see?           

1985
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:13,998
      I learn more about her    
      from her Facebook page    

1986
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:16,900
   than I do from our           
   scintillating conversation.  

1987
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:18,068
         Is he your boyfriend?  

1988
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,905
        Kind of.                

1989
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:23,023
         Have you met him?      
         Has he been around     
         the house?             

1990
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,358
              Sometimes.        

1991
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,877
               Sometimes? Zzz?  

1992
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,164
         You have a boyfriend!  

1993
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:31,899
                          Wow.  

1994
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,619
              Have you heard    
              of Sarah Palin?   

1995
01:04:34,688 --> 01:04:35,803
           Yes.                 

1996
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,272
          What's the one thing  
          you know about        

1997
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,739
         Sarah Palin's          
         17-year-old daughter?  

1998
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,542
     She's pregnant?            
                 That's right.  

1999
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,212
  And what is the one thing     
  that you are not going to be  

2000
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,215
         in a couple of years   
         when you turn 17?      

2001
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,417
       Pregnant?                
                 That's right!  

2002
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,285
         All right, now,        
         what are the two ways  

2003
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,670
          that you can achieve  
          that goal?            

2004
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:53,971
               First is         

2005
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:57,024
       not have any sex, okay?  

2006
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,443
   That's the first way, okay?  
   Just not engage in that.     

2007
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,263
       That did not             
       work out very well       
       for your mother and me.  

2008
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:03,864
 And what's the second way?     

2009
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,266
 Where you going?               
             Bathroom.          

2010
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,200
       You don't have to go     
       to the bathroom.         

2011
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,703
        Sit down, Mason,        
        just sit down.          

2012
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,172
     What's the second way?     

2013
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:14,275
                          Huh?  

2014
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:15,793
           Has your mother      
           talked to you guys   
           about this stuff?    

2015
01:05:15,862 --> 01:05:16,710
         No, Dad!               

2016
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,479
                No, come on,    
                has she talked  
                to you about    

2017
01:05:19,399 --> 01:05:20,698
             contraception?     

2018
01:05:22,134 --> 01:05:23,267
                          Huh?  

2019
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:24,969
          What, has she...      
          Condoms?              

2020
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,871
        She talked about that?  
 No, Dad, please, stop.         

2021
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,172
                 What?          

2022
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:30,891
                Does Garret     
                have a condom?  
     Oh, God!                   

2023
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,360
 Dad!                           
             (CHUCKLING) What?  
             Come on.           

2024
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,428
   Sam, we have to be able to   
   talk about this, all right?  

2025
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,264
               Come on, we do.  
               We can do it,    
               we can do it.    

2026
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,931
       Just stay with me here,  
       all right?               

2027
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,701
     It's as hard for me        
     as it is for you.          
     But seriously, all right?  

2028
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,254
       I read an article        
       in the paper             
       the other day that said  

2029
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:47,841
     that although              
     US teenagers are not       
     the most sexually active,  

2030
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,478
   we have the highest rate     
   of teenage pregnancy, okay?  

2031
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:52,997
                     Hey.       

2032
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:54,432
 Oh, hey, Tammy,                
 how you doing?                 
              What's going on?  

2033
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:55,566
              Nice to see you.  

2034
01:05:55,635 --> 01:05:57,334
 Oh, yeah,                      
 good to see you.               
                     Yeah.      

2035
01:05:57,336 --> 01:05:59,186
         Um, Tammy, this is     
         my daughter Samantha.  
                     Hey.       

2036
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:01,022
 And this is, uh,               
 Mason Junior right here.       

2037
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,239
 TAMMY: Mason Junior.           
 MASON SR.: Tammy.              

2038
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:03,641
 Say hi.                        
                 Hi.            

2039
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,293
  Hi, Mason, nice to meet you.  
  Heard a lot about you guys.   

2040
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,895
 What're you doing here?        

2041
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:09,397
            I'm just here       
            with some friends.  

2042
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,399
       Oh, wow.                 
                    Yeah.       

2043
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,699
      What are you guys up to?  

2044
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,734
 Um, we're going camping.       

2045
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,820
         Well, no, this one     
         is not going camping.  

2046
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,288
             This one is going  
             to a party.        

2047
01:06:17,356 --> 01:06:19,090
               Oh, fun.         

2048
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:20,974
     But we, the men,           
     are going camping.         

2049
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,443
   The boys are going camping.  

2050
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,478
         All right, very nice.  

2051
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:27,781
         Well, uh, we still on  
         for tomorrow?          
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.        

2052
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,650
 No, I'll drop him off at 7:00  
 and then I'll just call you.   

2053
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:30,784
                         Okay.  
             Right?             

2054
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,920
       Great. It was really     
       nice meeting you both.   

2055
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,322
 Take care.                     

2056
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,507
        Talk to you soon. Bye.  
 I'll see you.                  
 I'll see you.                  

2057
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,161
         Don't look at me       
         like that, all right?  

2058
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,032
         Look, just to finish   
         the point, okay?       

2059
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:48,185
        I was 23 when           
        your mom had you,       
        all right? So was she.  

2060
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,420
      All right, and we didn't  
      put ourselves             

2061
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:52,557
        in the best position    
        to be great parents.    

2062
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:55,343

       So, where're you going?

        What's going on there?

 My mom's a teacher.

          Oh, cool.             
          What does she teach?

2205
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,517
             Oh, my mom         
             owns Needleworks.

01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,385

2207

            kinda hangin' out.  

2208
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,989
            But I'm supposed    
            to be going to      
            the hospital soon.

2213
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:58,565
   I think so.                  

2214
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,600
      We used to be             
      best friends growing up,  

2215
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,569
             but we've kind of  
             grown apart.       

2216
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,671
        She sorta got all emo,  
        she thinks I'm a prep,  

2217
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:06,590
          but I still consider  
          her a friend.         

2218
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,058
            Anyway, she cut     
            one of her wrists.  

2219
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:11,262
         I don't know how bad,  
         but I think            
         I should go visit.     

2220
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:12,996
       So what're you reading?  

2221
01:14:13,065 --> 01:14:16,700
 Uh, it's                       
 <i> Breakfast of Champions.</i>       
 Kurt Vonnegut.                 

2222
01:14:16,769 --> 01:14:19,753
      I think my older brother  
      likes him.                

2223
01:14:19,821 --> 01:14:22,306
         I'm reading            
         <i> To Kill a Mockingbird</i> 
         for the third time.    

2224
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,840
               My friends       
               make fun of me.  

2225
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:25,709
     I think I'm the only girl  
     in the whole school        

2226
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:27,511
           who doesn't like     
           the <i> Twilight</i> books. 

2227
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,745
            Have you read 'em?  

2228
01:14:28,814 --> 01:14:30,180
    Sure haven't.               

2229
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:31,681
                  I tried,      

2230
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,417
         but it was so cheesy!  

2231
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,154
              So, how do you    
              like San Marcos?  

2232
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,989
 I like it all right.           

2233
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:42,826
 It's a lot smaller             
 than Houston,                  
 but it seems pretty cool.      

2234
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:44,094
  Have you always               
  lived here?                   

2235
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:45,329
                    Yeah.       

2236
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,730
     If you want                
     the big city around here,  

2237
01:14:46,798 --> 01:14:49,199
     you have to drive          
     to San Antonio or Austin.  

2238
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:51,067
      Have you been there yet?  

2239
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:52,969
 I went to San Antonio          
 for a day,                     

2240
01:14:53,038 --> 01:14:56,440
 but I haven't been             
 to Austin yet.                 

2241
01:14:56,509 --> 01:14:58,442
       That's where all         
       the high school kids go  

2242
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:00,511
          on weekends           
          for shows and stuff.  

2243
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,279
 That's what I've heard.        

2244
01:15:02,348 --> 01:15:04,414
             So, are you going  
             to Shauna's party  
             next weekend?      

2245
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:07,534
 Um, I think I heard about it.  
 I'm not really sure, though.   

2246
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:08,702
             Well, you should!  

2247
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:10,170
    Why's that?                 

2248
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,372
           Well, LeeAnne has    
           a big crush on you,  

2249
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,841
          and I know she was    
          hoping you would go.  

2250
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,810
         You don't have         
         a girlfriend, do you?  

2251
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:17,911
  Not currently.                

2252
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,546
              Well then,        
              you should come.  

2253
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,147
       I'll tell Chase to       
       make sure you're there.  

2254
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,482
        Okay.                   

2255
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,718
        But don't tell LeeAnne  
        I told you that.        
        She'd kill me.          

2256
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,019
       I won't.                 

2257
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:28,288
     Well, I better get going.  

2258
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:29,790
               See you later.   
        Bye.                    

2259
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:38,065
      OLIVIA: His cognitive     
      theories, his interviews  
      with orphans,             

2260
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,167
     ethology theorists' work,  

2261
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,569
           and then he in turn  

2262
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,472
        was supported strongly  
        by Harry Harlow's       
        rhesus monkey study.    

2263
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,157
              Now, you guys,    
              you gotta think,  

2264
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:49,893
            this is the 1950s,  
            this was radical!   

2265
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:52,563
         This flew in the face  
         of traditional         
         learning theory,       

2266
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:56,433
of B.F. Skinner's classical     
and instrumental conditioning.  

2267
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,486
              Now, Bowlby's     
              gonna argue that  

2268
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:04,425
     human survival depends     
     on us falling in love.     

2269
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:08,412
         It depends on me       
         falling in love        
         with my mother         

2270
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,947
      and my mother             
      falling in love with me.  

2271
01:16:11,016 --> 01:16:13,116
   And if that doesn't happen,  

2272
01:16:14,186 --> 01:16:16,002
   we're pretty much doomed.    

2273
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,304
       Now think about it.      

2274
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:20,741
    A tiger chases her tribe    
    out of a cave               

2275
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,510
    Now, an ideal mother goes,  
    (GASPS)                     

2276
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,280
 "My baby! I love you,          
 I'll protect you!"             

2277
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:30,384
    Or, "Well, you, why am      
    I gonna pick you up?        
    You're gonna slow me down.  

2278
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,852

           tiger kibble!"

         So, next week,         
         we are gonna get into  

2281

          of attachment.

01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,093
  Seemed like                   
  a decent paying job.          

2501
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,877
 And, uh, did my tour.          

2502
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:04,213

       I told them,             

2503
01:25:04,282 --> 01:25:07,016
       if there's               
       a world-changing event,  
       I'll come back.          

2504

   9/11 happened,               
   and I was back 9/12.         

2505
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:16,291
      And I'm proud to say      
      the 4-56, the whole time  
      we were there,

         not one casualty.

 to any of our advice.

  the polar opposite

3036
01:50:35,995 --> 01:50:37,979
 Why aren't you?                

3037
01:50:38,047 --> 01:50:42,116
     I mean, I guess            
     it's just being afraid of  
     what people would think.   

3038
01:50:42,184 --> 01:50:44,118
           You know, judgment.  
    Yeah.                       

3039
01:50:44,187 --> 01:50:46,120
 I guess it's really easy       
 to say like,                   

3040
01:50:46,189 --> 01:50:47,788
 "I don't care                  
 what anyone else thinks,"      

3041
01:50:47,857 --> 01:50:49,991
   but everyone does,           
   you know?                    
                      Exactly.  

3042
01:50:50,059 --> 01:50:51,758
           Deep down.           
                (BOTH CHUCKLE)  

3043
01:50:51,827 --> 01:50:55,513
      I find myself so furious  
      at all these people       
      that I'm in contact with  

3044
01:50:55,581 --> 01:50:58,148
       just for controlling me  
       or whatever,             

3045
01:50:58,217 --> 01:51:01,385
        but, you know,          
        they're not even aware  
        they're doing it.       

3046
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,220
 Yeah.                          

3047
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:08,726
 So, in this perfect world,     
 where no one's                 
 controlling you,               

3048
01:51:08,794 --> 01:51:11,194
  what's different?             
  What changes?                 

3049
01:51:12,164 --> 01:51:13,563
                   Everything.  

3050
01:51:13,565 --> 01:51:16,550
   I mean, I just wanna be      
   able to do anything I want,  

3051
01:51:16,619 --> 01:51:18,569
           because it makes me  
           feel alive.          

3052
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:22,656
  As opposed to giving me       
  the appearance of normality.  

3053
01:51:22,725 --> 01:51:25,158
 Whatever that means.           
 (CHUCKLES)                     

3054
01:51:25,227 --> 01:51:27,677
                I don't think   
                it means much.  

3055
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:32,065
 You're kinda weird,            
 you know that?                 
              (BOTH CHUCKLE)    

3056
01:51:32,368 --> 01:51:33,517
                         Yeah?  

3057
01:51:35,454 --> 01:51:36,803
         Is that a compliment?  

3058
01:51:36,872 --> 01:51:40,307
 I don't know.                  
 Do you wanna be weird?         

3059
01:51:40,376 --> 01:51:44,595
  I mean, I don't want to       
  like scare kids at the park,  
  or anything like that.        

3060
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:48,532
             I really like      
             talking with you.  

3061
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:51,502
          I don't usually       
          even try to vocalize  
          my thoughts           

3062
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:53,737
                  or feelings   
                  or anything.  

3063
01:51:53,806 --> 01:51:56,974
        I don't know,           
        it never sounds right.  
        Words are stupid.       

3064
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:01,478
 So, why are you                
 trying with me?                

3065
01:52:01,547 --> 01:52:04,131
   I don't know.                
   I guess I feel comfortable.  

3066
01:52:05,184 --> 01:52:06,833
        I'm glad.               
        (CHUCKLES)              

3067
01:52:10,957 --> 01:52:12,690
 Hey, Jim.                      

3068
01:52:12,758 --> 01:52:14,892
 I'm sorry I'm so late.         

3069
01:52:14,961 --> 01:52:17,210
          What time are you     
          supposed to be home?  

3070
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:21,314
 I don't know.                  
 A while ago.                   

3071
01:52:21,383 --> 01:52:25,986
               While ago like,  
               30 minutes ago,  
               an hour ago?     

3072
01:52:26,055 --> 01:52:28,071
         'Cause truthfully      
         nobody even knew       

3073
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:29,740
    where you were              
    until your sister told us.  

3074
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:31,775
         She's been home        
         for a while.           

3075
01:52:32,795 --> 01:52:34,494
 I'm sorry.                     

3076
01:52:34,564 --> 01:52:37,531
         Yeah, been hearin'     
         a lot of that lately.  

3077
01:52:38,801 --> 01:52:41,835
          See, but you          
          don't actually care.  

3078
01:52:41,904 --> 01:52:46,440
         You just kinda come    
         and go as you please,  

3079
01:52:46,508 --> 01:52:48,375
          and you don't care    
          if your mom's upset,  

3080
01:52:48,444 --> 01:52:50,844
            or what time        
            you gotta be home.  

3081
01:52:50,913 --> 01:52:52,446
            Is that what's up?  

3082
01:52:53,699 --> 01:52:54,898
 I don't know                   
 what to tell you.              

3083
01:52:54,967 --> 01:52:56,583
           Stop mumbling!

          I can't understand    
          a word comin' out     
          of your mouth.

3087
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:05,075
       And I ask you questions  
       and you just...          

3088
01:53:05,144 --> 01:53:07,878
 Can I just have one day        
 where everyone                 
 isn't all over my ass?         

3089
01:53:10,633 --> 01:53:12,499
              I'm up your ass?  

3090
01:53:14,203 --> 01:53:16,237
             This is my house.  
             All right?         

3091
01:53:16,305 --> 01:53:18,105

             in my house,       

3092
01:53:18,174 --> 01:53:20,474
         then you get home      
         when you say           
         you're gonna be home.

 you're not my dad.             

3094
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:23,827
         No, I'm not your dad.  

3095
01:53:23,896 --> 01:53:27,097
     You know how I know that?  
     'Cause I'm actually here.  

3096
01:53:27,165 --> 01:53:29,566
     I'm the guy with the job,  
     payin' the bills,          

3097
01:53:29,635 --> 01:53:33,337
        takin' care of you,     
        your mom, your sister,  
        huh? Huh?

01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:36,223
              I'm that guy!

                      Morning.  

3100
01:54:01,934 --> 01:54:06,403
    Hey. Which one of you guys  
    used the downstairs         
    bathroom last night?        

3101
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:08,772
 I don't know.                  
 I didn't.                      

3102
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,724
           That tall guy,       
           what's his name?     

3103
01:54:11,977 --> 01:54:13,210
            Phillip?            

3104
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:16,813
             Yeah, Phillip.     
             He did it.         
             Can Phillip read?  

3105
01:54:16,882 --> 01:54:18,014
       You know, there's        
       a big sign on the door.  

3106
01:54:18,083 --> 01:54:19,650
    It says,                    
    "Do not use this bathroom,  
    it's broken."               

3107
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:22,018
        I mean,                 
        how difficult is that?  

3108
01:54:22,754 --> 01:54:24,721
      I don't know.             
      I'm sorry.

3110
01:54:29,995 --> 01:54:31,828
            I think I'm gonna   
            put the house       
            on the market.      

3111
01:54:32,965 --> 01:54:34,464
            Why?                

3112
01:54:34,533 --> 01:54:35,816
 This house is too big for us.  

3113
01:54:35,885 --> 01:54:37,517
           You're going to      
           school eventually.   

3114
01:54:37,586 --> 01:54:40,237
           It's too expensive.  
           I'm done.            

3115
01:54:40,306 --> 01:54:43,257
 Why did you even buy it        
 in the first place then?       

3116
01:54:43,326 --> 01:54:46,860
   Because I really enjoy       
   making poor life decisions,  

3117
01:54:46,929 --> 01:54:50,264
         keeping us on          
         the brink of poverty.  

3118
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:53,767
     I've spent                 
     the first half of my life  
     acquiring all this crap,   

3119
01:54:53,836 --> 01:54:55,536
    and now I'm gonna spend     
    the second half of my life  

3120
01:54:55,605 --> 01:54:57,371
            getting rid         
            of all this stuff.  

3121
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:59,506
     Really? Like what?         

3122
01:55:00,843 --> 01:55:02,225
           Well, I got rid of   
           a couple husbands,   

3123
01:55:02,294 --> 01:55:03,626
         now I'm gonna get rid  
         of a mortgage,         

3124
01:55:03,695 --> 01:55:06,997
            some maintenance,   
            the tchotchskes,    

3125
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:10,834

01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:25,649
                 Fine.          

3132
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:27,918
          I'll be a poor whore  
          with a big house.

      don't leave me            
      that dirty dish to wash.

   then you're a professional.

02:00:40,099 --> 02:00:42,932
      It's like when they       
      realized it was gonna be  
      too expensive             

3248
02:00:43,002 --> 02:00:47,537
           to actually build    
           cyborgs and robots.  

3249
02:00:47,606 --> 02:00:49,172
      I mean, the costs         
      of that were impossible.  

3250
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:50,974
               They decided to  
               just let humans  

3251
02:00:51,043 --> 02:00:53,176
               turn themselves  
               into robots.     

3252
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:54,977
           That's what's        
           going on right now.  

3253
02:00:55,046 --> 02:00:56,046
 Oh, right now?                 

3254
02:00:56,115 --> 02:00:57,614
        Yeah! I mean, why not?  

3255
02:00:57,683 --> 02:01:01,551
    There're billions of us     
    just laying around,         
    not really doing anything.  

3256
02:01:02,905 --> 02:01:04,605
       We don't cost anything.  

3257
02:01:04,673 --> 02:01:09,610
   We're even pretty good       
   at self-maintenance          
   and reproducing constantly.  

3258
02:01:09,678 --> 02:01:14,448
       And as it turns out,     
       we're already            
       biologically programmed  

3259
02:01:14,516 --> 02:01:16,316
              for our little    
              cyborg upgrades.  

3260
02:01:16,385 --> 02:01:18,151
   How?                         
                  Seriously.    

3261
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:20,487
    I read this thing           
    the other day about how...  

3262
02:01:20,556 --> 02:01:23,356
      When you hear             
      that ding on your inbox,  

3263
02:01:23,425 --> 02:01:26,159
               you get like     
               a dopamine rush  
               in your brain.   

3264
02:01:26,228 --> 02:01:27,894
         It's like we're being  
         chemically rewarded    

3265
02:01:27,963 --> 02:01:31,014
        for allowing ourselves  
        to be brainwashed.      

3266
02:01:31,083 --> 02:01:34,784
     How evil is that?          
     We're fucked.              

3267
02:01:34,853 --> 02:01:37,571
 (SCOFFS) So you deleting       
 your Facebook page             
 is gonna change all that?      

3268
02:01:39,007 --> 02:01:41,942
 Remember when Trevor deleted   
 his Facebook page last year    

3269
02:01:42,011 --> 02:01:43,877
 and everyone just hated him?   

3270
02:01:43,946 --> 02:01:45,512
 You made more fun              
 of him than anyone.            

3271
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:47,196
             I still make fun   
             of Trevor though.  

3272
02:01:48,834 --> 02:01:52,134
 It was like he was             
 so pathetically desperate      
 for attention.                 

3273
02:01:52,203 --> 02:01:53,936
 Or to be different,            
 or something.                  

3274
02:01:54,005 --> 02:01:57,391
 That's just 'cause             
 they did that lame story       
 about it in the school paper.  

3275
02:01:57,459 --> 02:01:59,175
 And then he had to make        
 a big announcement about it    

3276
02:01:59,245 --> 02:02:01,044
 when he came back              
 a month later.                 

3277
02:02:01,113 --> 02:02:03,013
 That's the thing, though,      
 I'm not doing it               
 for attention.                 

3278
02:02:03,081 --> 02:02:06,449
  I just wanna try              
  and not live my life          
  through a screen.             

3279
02:02:06,518 --> 02:02:10,586
  I want some kind of           
  actual interaction.           

3280
02:02:10,655 --> 02:02:14,691
     A real person,             
     not just the profile       
     they put up.               

3281
02:02:14,759 --> 02:02:17,043
 Oh, I'm sorry.                 
 Were you saying something?     

3282
02:02:17,045 --> 02:02:18,661
   Yeah, okay,                  
   I know you're joking.        

3283
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:20,263
      But, I mean,              
      it's kind of true.        

3284
02:02:20,331 --> 02:02:22,949
  You have been, you know,      
  checking your phone           
  this whole time,              

3285
02:02:23,018 --> 02:02:24,751
       so, what're you          
       really doing?            

3286
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:27,920
      You don't care what       
      your friends are up to    
      on a Saturday afternoon,  

3287
02:02:27,989 --> 02:02:33,527
  but you're also obviously     
  not fully experiencing        
  my profound bitching.         

3288
02:02:33,595 --> 02:02:38,097
 So, yeah, it's like            
 everyone's just stuck in       
 like an in-between state.      

3289
02:02:38,166 --> 02:02:40,567
 Not really                     
 experiencing anything.         

3290
02:02:40,636 --> 02:02:42,802
 It's not an experience,        
 it's just information.         

3291
02:02:43,472 --> 02:02:45,772
 Look. For example,             

3292
02:02:45,841 --> 02:02:48,308
 I just got the address         
 of the club where              
 we're meeting them later,      

3293
02:02:48,377 --> 02:02:51,745
 so we won't be wandering       
 the streets of Austin          
 lost for an hour tonight.      

3294
02:02:51,813 --> 02:02:53,813
 Thank you                      
 very much, Facebook.           

3295
02:02:53,882 --> 02:02:55,599
 And then I just texted         
 my mom back.                   

3296
02:02:55,667 --> 02:02:58,101
    Oh, that's groundbreaking.  

3297
02:02:58,169 --> 02:02:58,602
       She hasn't seen you in,  
       like, 55 minutes?
