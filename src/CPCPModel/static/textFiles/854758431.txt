        No! I'm doing           
        good cop, bad cop.

00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,752
               You know,        
               I can hear you.

00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,153
              Shut up!

00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,874
 Just please,                   
 don't do anything crazy.       

6
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,726
       I won't do               
       anything crazy.          

7
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:15,313
    What am I gonna             
    do that's crazy?            
    I'm a police officer. Huh?

              Am I gonna shoot  
              you in the dick?  

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,900
 You said nothing crazy,        
 and that is a no-no!           

10
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,185
            No-no!              

11
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,904
     Turn around.               
     I need you to              
     pass a polygraph.          

12
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:24,872
       Put it away!             
            Turn around!

        Don't worry,            
        she won't do it.        
        She won't do anything.  

14
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:30,661
 So you want to                 
 gamble with your scrotum       
 and your testicles?            

15
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,097

18

           I'll tell you what   
           we're gonna do...    
           play a little game.  

19
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,270
         I'm gonna take         
         out these bullets.     

20
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,573
            Except this one.    
            Because this is     
            my favorite.        

21
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:42,908
      I'm gonna                 
      keep that in there.       

22
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,976
          And then              
          you're gonna tell me  
          where Larkin is.      

23
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,228

       tell me when and where   

24

              that shipment

25

26

        I'm gonna kill you      
        and everyone you know.

             That's not what    
             I asked.

        take the gun from her!

  save your scrotum?            

31

 coming in?

33
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,631
            All right!          
            There's a shipment  
            on Wednesday!

               I don't know!    

36
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,970
       Tell her!                
       Just tell her            
       where it is!             

37
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,605
             Don't shoot me     
             in the dick!       

38
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,640
      I don't know!             
      It's gonna be Wednesday!  
      That's four shots!        

39
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,742
            Don't take          
            any more shots!     

40
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,377
 Just tell her                  
 where it's coming in!

  Julian and LeSoire in?

00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,918
 You out of your minds?         
             Wasn't too smart.  

45
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,803
             Oh. So you're not  
             supposed to        
             arrest someone     

46
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:31,389
       when they commit murder  
       and try and kill you?    

47
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,791
 You wanted us to               
 keep them on the street?       

48
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,977
    You shouldn't               
    even have been there!       

49
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,012
   Larkin is the big catch,     
   not those two!               

50
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,781
      Now we're never           
      gonna be able to...       

51
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,816
 Craig! Calm down!              
 We can all hear you.           

52
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,118
 Yeah, dogs can hear you.       

53
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,869
 Of course dogs                 
 can hear me!                   

54
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,606
 Are you okay?                  
 Because you look               
 really pale.                   

55
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,440
    It's a genetic condition!   

56
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,775
 Ashburn, come here.            

57
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,510
 Fucking snow cone.             

58
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,030

 That's a good one              
 because I'm really white!

 Can I have a moment            
 with my agent, please?         

60
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,137
        (SOFTLY) I'm good.      

61
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,373
          All right. I'm gonna  
          be right over there.  

62
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,775
                Right there.    

63
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,310
 Thank you.                     

64
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,962
   Why didn't you               
   alert anyone                 

65
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,964
 once you found evidence        
 of Julian's whereabouts?       

66
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,632
      It was                    
      an unconfirmed lead.      

67
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,134
    I wasn't gonna              
    waste anyone's time         
    until I knew it was real.   

68
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,471
    Give it a rest.             
    I want you to               
    stand down...               

69
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,591
 ...while I figure out how      
 to repair all this shit        
 with the DEA.                  

70
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,625
       Sir, no, please.         
       I swear I've been doing  

71
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,060
          everything you sent   
          me out here to do.    

72
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,695
           We've been doing     
           such good work.      

73
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:29,647
       I know you are.          

74
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,616
        It's just...            

75
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,220
   I don't know, it's...        
   never easy when              
   you are involved.            

76
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,081
         Fuck that guy.         

77
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,399
 If you're not in trouble,      
 you're not doing your job.     

78
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,534
                 Yeah.          

79
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,587
       We should go             
       get a drink.             
       Right?                   

80
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:54,188
    What's the point            
    of being a cop              

81
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,740
 if you can't get one drink     
 at the end of the night?       

82
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,158
              That's what I'm   
              talking about!    

83
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,827
 I said I just want one.        

84
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,995
           Oh, no, no, here...  
           it is one.           

85
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,431
           Sometimes he just    
           likes to do          
           this thing where...  

86
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,569
         ...he pours them in    
         three little glasses,  
         but it's one.          

87
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:10,004
               All right,       
               here we go!      

88
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,039
         Let's loosen that up.  

89
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,341
  Okey-dokey.                   

90
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,332
                There you go.   

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,667
                 There you go.  
                 Keep a pace.   
 (MUFFLED) Okay.                

92
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,519
               Don't spit       
               that shit out.   
               It's not free.   

93
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:25,970
                 Let's go.      

94
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,405
                Keep that in.   

95
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,240
   Ooh.                         

96
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,777
     Hey, how you doing?        
     I haven't heard from you.  

97
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,178
               Shit.            

98
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,132
             No, you haven't.   

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,350
        Well, did I do          
        something wrong, or...  

100
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,918
            (SIGHS DEEPLY)      

101
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,689
         Okay, here we go.      

102
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,307
        It's not you, it's me.  

103
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,227
       Uh, I'm still            
       working on myself.       

104
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,496
   So I can't be a part of two  
   until I'm a better one.      

105
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,798
                You don't have  
                to do that.

 meant to me,

 be best to just...

 If I'm going,                  
 Gina's going!                  

319
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,237
  I'm not going                 
  unless we get Gina.           

320
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,405
 Just get in.                   

321
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,473
       We're getting Gina.      

322
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,092
 Move your feet,                
 I'll chop 'em off!             

323
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,760
        We're going to Gina's!  

324
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:36,497
 MULLINS:                       
 I hope a truck hits us         
 and we all die.                

325
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,752
 What the fuck is               
 this girl doing?               

326
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,109
 Could she go any slower?       
 Could she                      
 physically go slower?          

327
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,359
 MRS. MULLINS:                  
 Go get your girlfriend.        

328
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,094
               PETER:           
               She's fine, Ma!  

329
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,280
              I forgot my       
              curling iron,     
              Mrs. Mullins!     

330
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,483
 Come on, Gina,                 
 get in the car!                

331
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:56,950
       What the fuck?           

332
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,569
 I got you the rollie           
 so you could roll the bag!     
 So get over here!              

333
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:00,554
          You kidding?          

334
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,722
     You bought me              
     a bag for Christmas        

335
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,424
   so that I could              
   carry my own luggage?        

336
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,092
 Gina, come on...               
 let's go.                      

337
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,877
 I'm gonna get you              
 a dick-sucker for Christmas    

338
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,178
 so I don't have to             
 do it no more.                 

339
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,397
          MRS. MULLINS:         
          Go get her! Jesus!    
 I'm going!                     

340
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:11,716
        Gina!                   
        You really didn't       
        say that.               

341
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,883
 Oh, that's why                 
 you're here.                   

342
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,218
            MRS. MULLINS:       
            Go get her.         

343
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,554
 Come on, Pete,                 
 just break up                  
 with this girl!                

344
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,188
       Let's go, let's go!      

345
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,406
     You're making a scene,     
     you assholes!              

346
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,209
  You think you're man enough?  
  You fucking man enough?       

347
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,229
 Knock it off!                  
 Just knock it off!             

348
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,080
     I got this!                

349
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,649
     Hey! Assholes!             

350
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:31,552
 Get in the car!                
 Get in the car!                
 Get in the car!                

351
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,020
              Did she just      
              pull out a gun?   

352
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,939
 You know what happens now?     
 You don't get this one!        

353
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,844
       So, Jason,               
       your family seems nice.  

354
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,112
        Yeah, we have           
        our good days.          

355
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,813
        My make-up is           
        in that one.            

356
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,815
 I'll rip your                  
 pants off!                     

357
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:46,716
         (ALL ARGUING)          

358
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,562
           If we just knew      
           where that shipment  
           was coming to,       

359
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,231
            we would have       
            Larkin and Julian.  

360
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,600
     They would both be there,  
     and we could get them.     

361
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,452
  I'm just happy                
  that Jason is out             
  of there for now.             

362
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,771
                    Yeah.       

363
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,289
              Shame, though.    

364
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,558
       Having your              
       brother on the inside    
       would be a coup for us.  

365
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:12,710
     That's what you            
     want to say?               

366
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,061
 Because you're                 
 saying that out loud.          

367
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,231
    You would say               
    exactly the same thing      
    if it wasn't your brother.  

368
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,983
 We're done                     
 talking about this.            

369
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,501
      So if it was just         
      some random drug dealer,  

370
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:21,935
             you wouldn't       
             send him back in?  

371
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,537
        If it was               
        someone like Rojas ...  

372
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,405
 We're not talking              
 about Rojas.                   

373
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,741
  We're talking                 
  about my brother,             
  you fuckwit.                  

374
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,710
     We all have a lot to lose  
     if we don't catch Larkin.  

375
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:31,878
      What do you               
      have to lose?             

376
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:32,980
               I have a lot.    

377
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,664
 Some bullshit promotion?       

378
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,717
 You don't give                 
 a shit about my family         

379
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,935
 or if Jason                    
 gets out there                 
 and gets killed.               

380
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,770
           I feel you're        
           not being honest.    

381
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,057
   Because nobody               
   forced your brother          
   to get involved with drugs.  

382
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,124
    You're an asshole           
    for that.                   

383
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,227
              Okay, that's not  
              helping, either.  

384
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,628
            I'm trying to       
            create a dialogue.  

385
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,464
           Note that I          
           start my statements  
           with "I feel".       

386
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,316
     Oh, I feel like            
     you're an asshole.         

387
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,918
         You know what I feel?  

388
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,053
          I feel that you       
          have worn that shirt  
          every day this week.  

389
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,955
         And I feel that you    
         turning it inside out  

390
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,356
             does not make it   
             a new shirt.       

391
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,041
 Well, I feel like              
 it does                        

392
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,210
                Oh, really?     
                Well, I feel    
                I disagree.     

393
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,545
      Must be nice.             
                  What?         

394
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:07,314
 Must be really nice            
 for you to know everything.    

395
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,533
 To be so much smarter          
 than everybody else.           

396
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,202
    I don't profess             
    to know everything,         
    but I do know quite a bit.  

397
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,438
    What I know is accurate     
    and scientifically proven,  

398
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,989
         and I share that       
         information with you.  

399
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,341
        If you have             
        a problem with that,    

400
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,076
           tune me out          
           like you always do.  

401
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,728
           WOMAN:               
           Help! He's choking!  

402
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,264
            Okay, I've got it.  

403
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,148
      Somebody call             
      an ambulance!             

404
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,335
  Check his mouth!              

405
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,337
        There's nothing there!  
 Okay, lay him down.            

406
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,656
 Sir, relax.                    
 Everything will be fine.       

407
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:34,658
               Let me get       
               his head back.   

408
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:37,594
         He's choking.          
         I need a knife         
         and a straw, please!   

409
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,364
 A knife and a straw!           
 Why a knife and a straw?       

410
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,282
     I'm going to perform       
     an emergency tracheotomy.  

411
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,750
             I'll need          
             a glass of vodka.  

412
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,586
 Vodka! It's a Denny's!         

413
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:46,920
            For sterilization.  
            Hot water!          

414
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:47,972
 Do you know                    
 what you're doing?             

415
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,073
            Technically, no...  

416
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,875
           ...but I've been     
           doing some research  

417
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,210
         and I feel fairly      
         confident I know how.  

418
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,578
 He's still choking!            

419
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,246
         Sir, what I'm going    
         to do is find your...  

420
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,582
 Please don't                   
 put that in there.             
        Shh. Stop touching me.  

421
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,919
 I think the cricothyroid       
 membrane is here.              
 I'll make a small incision...

       I can help you.          

1530
00:51:20,197 --> 00:51:20,197
           You'll help me?      
          Yeah.                 

1531
00:51:20,198 --> 00:51:20,198
      Where can I find Julian?  

1532
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:20,199
  I get my stuff from           
  this bitch named Tatiana      
  on Newkirk Avenue.            

1533
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:20,200
         Can you describe her?  

1534
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:20,201
    She got brown eyes.         

1535
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:20,202
     She got some               
     big-ass breastses.         

1536
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:20,203
     Big breastses.             
                    Okay.       

1537
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:20,204
              Can you maybe be  
              a little bit      
              more specific?    

1538
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:20,205
 Her breastses is like this.    

1539
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:20,206
              Okay. Thank you.  

1540
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:20,207
        Don't.                  

1541
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:20,208
 Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!           
 We're at a comedy party!       

1542
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:20,209
                Move the fuck   
                out of my way.  
                Get a room.     

1543
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:20,210
 Tim, you still owe me $40.     

1544
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:20,211
     Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!   
     Fucking dickweed.          

1545
00:51:20,212 --> 00:51:20,212
        Why is the cage empty?  

1546
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:20,213
    What did I tell you         
    about moving my prisoners?  

1547
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:20,214
   He's in interrogation.       

1548
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:20,215
 Why would he be                
 in interrogation               
 when I'm standing right here?  

1549
00:51:20,216 --> 00:51:20,216
    They came and got him.      

1550
00:51:20,217 --> 00:51:20,217
                 Who's "they"?  

1551
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:20,218
       It better be two of me.  
       Is it two of me?         

1552
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:20,219
       It was a lady.           

1553
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,220
       I'm a lady.              
       Did I come and get him?  

1554
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:20,221
    No, it was                  
    a different lady.           
    She was nice.               

1555
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:20,222
      I'm fucking nice.         
      Why was she nice to you?  

1556
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:20,223
      She made me               
      give her the keys.        

1557
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:20,224
        I'm gonna make you      
        fucking bend over...    

1558
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:20,225
        ...and I'm gonna        
        reach up your ass       
        into your pocket        

1559
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:20,226
        and get the keys        
        to your house.          

1560
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:20,227
 Then I'm gonna drive there...  

1561
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:20,228
   ...come in your front door   
   and kill you in your sleep.  

1562
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:20,229
   I think I have a clear idea  
   of what we're looking for,   

1563
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,230
              and I appreciate  
              your time.        

1564
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:20,231
      Wow, lady, you're on      
      a real fucking roll.      

1565
00:51:20,232 --> 00:51:20,232
                    Excuse me?  

1566
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:20,233
     No, I won't excuse you.    

1567
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:20,234
 I just spent                   
 the last 30 minutes            
 thinking of ways to kill you.  

1568
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:20,235
        I'm sorry,              
        when did we meet?       

1569
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:20,236
 Is this your lawyer?           

1570
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:20,237
Are you an insurance salesman?  
Do you sell                     
those shitty suits?             

1571
00:51:20,238 --> 00:51:20,238
      I'm Special Agent         
      Sarah Ashburn.            
      How can I help you?       

1572
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:20,239
 You can get all of that        
 and get the fuck out of here.  

1573
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,240
  This is my room               

1574
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:20,241
    Were you about to be        
    questioned by a detective?  

1575
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:20,242
    I am a detective            
    and that's my perp.         

1576
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:20,243
       Ah! I understand now.    

1577
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:20,244
       Detective, Mr. Rojas     
       will be continuing on    
       with me.                 

1578
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:20,245
              No.               
  It's a jurisdictional issue.  

1579
00:51:20,246 --> 00:51:20,246
      Not gonna happen.         

1580
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:20,247
  Your efforts are duly noted.  

1581
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:20,248
         Oh, great.             

1582
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:20,249
       And if you're okay       
       with everything,         
       could you just...        

1583
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:20,250
          ...close the door     
          on the way out?       
 I'll shut the door on you.     

1584
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:20,251
   Will you lay down            
   and put your head            
   in the door?                 

1585
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:20,252
  I'll slam it                  
  about 157,000 times.          

1586
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:20,253
              Aw, shit, girl,   
              you better run.   

1587
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:20,254
      Shut your mouth.          
         Run like you on fire.  

1588
00:51:20,255 --> 00:51:20,255
           Be quiet.            

1589
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:20,256
      Get up and we'll          
      settle this outside.      

1590
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:20,257
    I won't be going outside.   

1591
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:20,258
   You're gonna get up          
   and come outside.            

1592
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:20,259
          No, ma'am.            

1593
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:20,260
   Fine. We'll do this inside.  

1594
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:20,261
       Can somebody remove      
       this person from         
       the interrogation room?  

1595
00:51:20,262 --> 00:51:20,262
     Mental illness is          
     nothing to be ashamed of.  
     It runs in many families.  

1596
00:51:20,263 --> 00:51:20,263
   I'm gonna hit you.           

1597
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:20,264
     You're not. Please don't.  

1598
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:20,265
 I'm gonna hit you              
 and knock all                  
 your little buttons.           

1599
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:20,266
 I'm gonna hit you there,       
 or here...                     

1600
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:20,267
             Do not put         
             your finger in...  

1601
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:20,268
     Stop touching my buttons!  

1602
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:20,269
 Stop wearing buttons.          

1603
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:20,270
      Don't move those          
      fucking hands at me.      

1604
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:20,271
 I'll get that                  
 stupid barrette!               

1605
00:51:20,272 --> 00:51:20,272
     I'll take that barrette    
     right out of               
     your fucking hair!         

1606
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:20,273
 Stop, stop, stop!              

1607
00:51:20,274 --> 00:51:20,274
 Both of you...my office now.   

1608
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:20,275
           Nope. Not in there.  

1609
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:20,276
    There is nothing            
    I can do, Mullins.          
    The FBI has jurisdiction.   

1610
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:20,277
 Maybe they're in here.         

1611
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:20,278
   Stop. Will you stop?         

1612
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:20,279
                 Nope, they're  
                 not in there.  

1613
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,280
    What is she doing?          

1614
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:20,281
            She's looking       
            for my balls.       

1615
00:51:20,282 --> 00:51:20,282
    Hey, if anyone sees         
    the Captain's balls...      

1616
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:20,283
    ...let me know.             
    They're about this big,     
    but a lot tinier.           

1617
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:20,284
  They're like a pea...or       
  like a ball bearing.          

1618
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:20,285
   Or if you've ever            
   seen a mouse ball,           
   about half that size.        

1619
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:20,286
   Incredibly tiny.             
   They're like really,         
   really tiny...               

1620
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:20,287
 ...little girl balls.          
 If little girls had balls.     

1621
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:20,288
 So if you find little,         
 tiny girl balls...             

1622
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:20,289
 ...that are                    
 so fucking tiny                
 and shriveled up...            

1623
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:20,290
 ...let me know,                
 because I'll put them          
 right back up his scrotum!     

1624
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:20,291
        Knock it off.           

1625
00:51:20,292 --> 00:51:20,292
 How about you do               
 something for once?            

1626
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:20,293
   What do you want me to do?   

1627
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:20,294
 Have my back                   

1628
00:51:20,295 --> 00:51:20,295
 and stop being so              
 goddamn disappointing          
 like everybody else!           

1629
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:20,296
 Well, that was professional.   

1630
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:20,297
    Was that not professional?  
    Here.                       

1631
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:20,298
       Let me be professional.  
       Let me help you          
       pick up your bag.        

1632
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:20,299
   That's very mature.          

1633
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:20,300
      Let me just               
      straighten that shit up.  

1634
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:20,301
           Oh, wait, hey!       

1635
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:20,302
        Good news! Good news,   
        I found his balls!      

1636
00:51:20,303 --> 00:51:20,303
    In a clear sack!            
    Yeah, enjoy that.           
    Shove those back up there.  

1637
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:20,304
             Cop of the year!   

1638
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:20,305
        Keep it up!             

1639
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:20,306
    This job is destroying me.  

1640
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:20,307
        You know how old I am?  

1641
00:51:20,308 --> 00:51:20,308
              58?               

1642
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,309
            I'm 43 years old.   

1643
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:20,310
         Mmm-hmm.               

1644
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:20,311
 Well, I always round up.       

1645
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:20,312
    I have a five-year-old son  
    who calls me grandpa!       

1646
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:20,313
     So, uh...anyhoo, sir...    

1647
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:20,314
       ...if you could          
       just...you know...       

1648
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:20,315
 ...keep her...away from me...  

1649
00:51:20,316 --> 00:51:20,316
       ...that would            
       be...very helpful.       

1650
00:51:20,317 --> 00:51:20,317
          She stole your keys,  
          didn't she?           

1651
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:20,318
          Yes, she did.         
          Do you know where     
          I can find her?       

1652
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:20,319
   She's probably               
   at O'Flanagan's.             
   It's a bar down the street.  

1653
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:20,320
       It's a little divey.     
       You might want           
       to wear a vest.          

1654
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:20,321
   <i>  Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack</i> 

1655
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:20,322
     <i>  I'm next to that cheese</i> 
     <i> like rat traps</i>            

1656
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:20,323
       <i>  On top of that green</i>  
       <i> like grass ass</i>          

1657
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:20,324
      <i>  That's over y'all head</i> 
      <i> like snapbacks</i>           

1658
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:20,325
     <i>  I get it where I fit in,</i>
     <i> put up then I put in</i>      

1659
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:20,326
   <i>  Tryna find an ass</i>         
   <i> I can put my fucking foot in</i>

1660
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:20,327

       <i> no, I run this shit</i>     

1661
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:20,328
   <i>  Don't give one fuck, bitch</i>
   <i> I done this shit...</i>         

1662
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:20,329
 <i>  I did what I say I did... </i> 

1663
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:20,330
   ASHBURN: Hand them over.     
   Give me the keys. Now.       

1664
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:20,331
        Oh, my God.             

1665
00:51:20,332 --> 00:51:20,332
    Did you drop something?     

1666
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:20,333
     I apologize.               

1667
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:20,334
          You are so concerned  
          about taking down     
          a guy like Rojas...   

1668
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:20,335
      ...wasting all this time  

1669
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:20,336
  when I could have             
  stopped a drug lord           
  who is far more dangerous...  

1670
00:51:20,337 --> 00:51:20,337
            ...and supplies to  
            people like Rojas.  

1671
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:20,338
     Bullshit. Who?             

1672
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:20,339
          Okay, you want to     
          see some bull feces?  

1673
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,340
 I think I said "bullshit".     

1674
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:20,341
     Here's some bull poo-poo.  
     How does that look?        

1675
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:20,342
                     See that?  
  Oh, come on.                  
  I got a kid here.             

1676
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:20,343
             Oh, I'm so sorry.  

1677
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:20,344
         I'm very, very sorry.  

1678
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:20,345
                Wait a minute,  
                this is a bar.  

1679
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:20,346
           No, absolutely not.  
           No, no, no, no.      

1680
00:51:20,347 --> 00:51:20,347
 Why do I not know              
 who Simon Larkin is?           

1681
00:51:20,348 --> 00:51:20,348
        That would probably be  
        because the FBI knows   
        more than you do.       

1682
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:20,349
 Anything happening             
 in my neighborhood             
 I have a right to know.        

1683
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:20,350
       No, you actually don't.  
       You want to know.        

1684
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:20,351
            And you do not      
            have the clearance  

1685
00:51:20,352 --> 00:51:20,352
         that would allow you   
         to read everything     
         that is in this file.  

1686
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:20,353
    Okay, all right!            

1687
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:20,354
 When bad shit happens          
 in my neighborhood,            

1688
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:20,355
 I get a little                 
 passionate about it.           

1689
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:20,356
 I shouldn't have               
 read your files.               
 I went too far.                

1690
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:20,357
                Well, I accept  
                your apology.   

1691
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:20,358
    But you need to understand  
    that this is                
    a highly important case.    

1692
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:20,359
           And the information  
           is highly,           
           highly sensitive.    

1693
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:20,360
             Therefore we have  
             these clearances.  

1694
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:20,361
 I don't have the clearances.   
 Right? I mean, you are...      

1695
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:20,362
  You are, wow, FBI.            

1696
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:20,363
    I mean,                     
    you are a goddamn           
    angel of the law.           

1697
00:51:20,364 --> 00:51:20,364
      Well, that's a little...  

1698
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:20,365
   I want you to                
   spread those wings           
   and just soar.               

1699
00:51:20,366 --> 00:51:20,366
                     Watch it!  

1700
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:20,367
   You watch it.                
   I'm a federal agent.         

1701
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:20,368
   WOMAN: Oh, yeah?             
   Well, guess what, you dick!  
   I'm a federal agent, too!    

1702
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:20,369
              I work at         
              the post office.  

1703
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:20,370
 Well, I appreciate             
 the work you do for us         
 on the ground. Thank you.      

1704
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:20,371
      You bet your ass you do.  

1705
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:20,372
             I see no one       
             will be getting    
             their mail today!  

1706
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:20,373
 MULLINS: Good burn.            

1707
00:51:20,374 --> 00:51:20,374
 Good burn.                     
 You got burned,                
 you big drunk paddy!           

1708
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:20,375
       WOMAN: Eat my            
       fucking Irish ass!       

1709
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:20,376
               So we are good?  

1710
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:20,377
     Thank you.                 
                    Thank you.  

1711
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:20,378
 America thanks you.            

1712
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:20,379
                 And I it.      

1713
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:20,380
       And it you.              

1714
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:20,381
                  Thank you.    

1715
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:20,382
         Whoa!                  

1716
00:51:20,383 --> 00:51:20,383
             Yes, okay.         

1717
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:20,384
               Good day.        

1718
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:20,385
       Dumbass.                 

1719
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:20,386
         MULLINS: <i> So how</i>       
         <i> you been, Jason?</i>      

1720
00:51:20,387 --> 00:51:20,387
       You want to talk         
       about Simon Larkin?      

1721
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:20,388
         I never heard of him.  

1722
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:20,389
  Don't lie to me.              

1723
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,390
 You're my brother,             
 I know when you're lying.      

1724
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:20,391
     I'm just a low-level guy.  

1725
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:20,392
          I heard of Larkin     
          but I never met him.  

1726
00:51:20,393 --> 00:51:20,393
 He's a goddamn animal,         
 and I'm trying to keep         
 him from meeting you.          

1727
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:20,394
    You gonna storm             
    through Boston              
    and take down a drug lord?  

1728
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:20,395
   Yeah, I might.               

1729
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:20,396
  Have you met me?              

1730
00:51:20,397 --> 00:51:20,397
          Yeah, unfortunately.  

1731
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:20,398
   Yeah, shut up. (CHUCKLES)    

1732
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:20,399
     Look, I get out tomorrow.  

1733
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,400
            I'm coming home.    
            I'm gonna be fine.  

1734
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:20,401
         I promise, all right?  

1735
00:51:20,402 --> 00:51:20,402
                    Oh!         
  Never approach me             
  if I'm not expecting you!     

1736
00:51:20,403 --> 00:51:20,403
      What are you, an animal?  

1737
00:51:20,404 --> 00:51:20,404
            You said you would  
            stay off my case,   

1738
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:20,405
          and now I find you    
          in front of           
          Tatiana's apartment.  

1739
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:20,406
      I live here.              

1740
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:20,407
    Oh, that's hilarious.       
    You know what's not funny?  

1741
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:20,408
             That you stole     
             a confidential     
             FBI case file.     

1742
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:20,409
     I don't remember           
     any of that.               

1743
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:20,410
          I'm going to say      
          it one more time.     
          Stand down, Officer.  

1744
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:20,411
       Fuck off, Officer.       

1745
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:20,412
    Oh, okay, now               
    you've really done it.      
    I'm going to call my boss.  

1746
00:51:20,413 --> 00:51:20,413
  Yeah, you do that,            
  tattle tits!                  

1747
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:20,414
                 Fucking narc!  

1748
00:51:20,415 --> 00:51:20,415
   Unbelievable. Unbelievable.  

1749
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:20,416
             (RINGING)          

1750
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:20,417
        <i> It's Ashburn, sir.</i>     
        <i> I need authorization...</i>

1751
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:20,418
        ...to suspend           
        a police officer        
        from my investigation.  

1752
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:20,419
 Ashburn, why is working        
 with local authorities         
 a problem for you?             

1753
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:20,420
              <i> Sir, it's not.</i>   

1754
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:20,421
           I understand how     
           this might sound     
           coming from me...    

1755
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:20,422
...but I think this individual  
might actually                  
be mentally unstable.           

1756
00:51:20,423 --> 00:51:20,423
   Her captain says             
   she grew up                  
   on those streets             

1757
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:20,424
  and knows them                
  better than anyone.           

1758
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:20,425
   That seems like              
   an asset                     
   to our investigation.        

1759
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:20,426
                Sir, I...       

1760
00:51:20,427 --> 00:51:20,427
 No, just work with her.        

1761
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:20,428
 Show me you can do this        
 or forget the promotion.       

1762
00:51:20,429 --> 00:51:20,429
     Well, sir, no need to      
     take someone's badge.      
     I think I can, uh...       

1763
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:20,430
           I think I can work   
           something out, sir.  

1764
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:20,431
         All right. Thank you.  

1765
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:20,432
         You know, uh...        

1766
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:20,433
          I just...             

1767
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:20,434
 I think you and I got off      
 on the wrong foot.             

1768
00:51:20,435 --> 00:51:20,435
             Oh!                

1769
00:51:20,436 --> 00:51:20,436
  I don't know Boston,          
  and you obviously have...     

1770
00:51:20,437 --> 00:51:20,437
 ...a lot of resources          
 and a lot of knowledge         
 about the area that could be,  

1771
00:51:20,438 --> 00:51:20,438
    you know, useful.           

1772
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:20,439
      Probably very.            
    So, uh...                   

1773
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:20,440
 ...maybe we can work           
 together on this.              

1774
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:20,441
 I don't need your help         
 to take down Larkin.           

1775
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:20,442
     You wouldn't even have     
     known about Larkin         
     if not for me.             

1776
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:20,443
        So obviously            
        the FBI can get         
        information you can't.  

1777
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:20,444
 And there's a lot more         
 where that comes from. A lot!  

1778
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:20,445
 Maybe I just need              
 to hear a little               
 "I need your help, Mullins."   

1779
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:20,446
        I won't be doing that.  

1780
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,447
  Okay, then get your           
  ass back in your car.         

1781
00:51:20,448 --> 00:51:20,448
           This is ridiculous.  

1782
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:20,449
      I'm an FBI agent.         
      You're a police officer.  

1783
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:20,450
 "I need your help, Mullins."   

1784
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:20,451
    I need your help, Mullins.  

1785
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:20,452
What is this, a whisper party?  
I want that third floor         
to hear it.                     

1786
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:20,453
 "I need your help, Mullins."   
 Then give me                   
 a little echo on "Mullins".    

1787
00:51:20,454 --> 00:51:20,454
    I need your help, Mullins,  
    Mullins, Mullins...         

1788
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:20,455
 Just move. Move, move!         

1789
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:20,456
 God! Even in that,             
 you're annoying.               

1790
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:20,457
 I will work with you...        

1791
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:20,458
 ...as long as we're clear      
 that this is my case.          

1792
00:51:20,459 --> 00:51:20,459
              That's actually   
              not...correct.    

1793
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,460
       Awesome.                 
       Glad you see it my way.  

1794
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:20,461
  Careful of the car.           

1795
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:20,462
              Goddamn it.

              I got it.         

1797

      I got it.

           just let me...       

1799

1800

        I got it.

  Barbara Walters?              

1807
00:51:20,474 --> 00:51:20,474
  I thought we'd go             
  in there and bring in         
  some heat on her.             

1808
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:20,475
          I'm sorry, what does  
          that even mean?       

1809

    Me and you,                 
    we're the heat.             

1810
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:20,477
 We go in there,                
 interrogate her,               
 scare the shit out of her...

          "interrogation".      
          It's too aggressive.

         Don't poke me!         

1862
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:20,529
            Tatiana, I want to  
            get really real.    

1863
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:20,530
        You ready to get real?  
  Let's get real.               

1864
00:51:20,531 --> 00:51:20,531
      Okay, we both know        
      you've been blowing shit  
      up your nose all day.     

1865
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:20,532
        Man, I get it.          
        There's nothing more    
        I'd love to do than...  

1866
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:20,533
   ...slip into my camisole,    
   put my feet up,              
   have a little smack.         

1867
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:20,534
   Real good time,              
   maybe a couple cold ones,    

1868
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:20,535
   a little chip and dip,       
   watch some cartoons.         

1869
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:20,536
   I'd get a big                
   bowl of coke...              

1870
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:20,537
 I'd put my face in it,         
 cut it with                    
 a little Ritalin...            

1871
00:51:20,538 --> 00:51:20,538
 Heaven on fucking              
 earth, right?                  
               Sure.            

1872
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:20,539
   I'd camp out all week        
   for tickets to that show.    

1873
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:20,540
                 What is this,  
                 <i> Training Day?</i> 

1874
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:20,541
   All fucking week             
   I'd camp out for that!       

1875
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:20,542
  But you, you piece of shit,   
  you've been rolling           
  deep for a long time.         

1876
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:20,543
    And now it's time           
    you open up                 
    that goddamn mouth          

1877
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:20,544
     and tell us what           
     we want to know.           

1878
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:20,545
 You got good point.            
 I tell you what.               
 I open my mouth.               

1879
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:20,546
 You get the fuck               
 out my house now!              

1880
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:20,547
 How's that for open mouth?     

1881
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:20,548
 Fuck out! Get fuck out!        

1882
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:20,549
                Yeah, I'll get  
                the fuck out.   

1883
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:20,550
           All right.           

1884
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:20,551
   You should really            
   stop smoking because         
   it's an awfully bad habit.   

1885
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:20,552
 You're leaving                 
 half your lipstick             
 in the ashtray.                

1886
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:20,553
 I had a great aunt             
 that lost most of              
 her teeth to smoking.          

1887
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:20,554
          Good to know.         

1888
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:20,555
 A lot of fistfights,           
 too, but mostly smoking.       

1889
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:20,556
      We're gonna get           
      out of your hair.         

1890
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:20,557
       That is not front door.  

1891
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:20,558
       (SHRIEKS)                
          Put your hands        
          where I can see 'em!  

1892
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:20,559
           Don't fucking move.  

1893
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:20,560
       Is this your drug mule?  
        Oh, my gosh!            

1894
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:20,561
    TATIANA: That's my mother!  

1895
00:51:20,562 --> 00:51:20,562
       Do you have balloons     
       of horse up your ass?    

1896
00:51:20,563 --> 00:51:20,563
              You break         
              my fucking door!  

1897
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:20,564
         Stand down, Officer.   

1898
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:20,565
 Who closes the door            
 to take a shit?                

1899
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:20,566
                 Humans do.     

1900
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:20,567
       Don't touch underpants!  

1901
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:20,568
           Get out,             
           bull in china shop!  
           Out of my house!     

1902
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:20,569
              What the fuck's   
              wrong with you?   

1903
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:20,570
 Wow, you are just              
 all stick and no sugar.        

1904
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:20,571
         Did you get            
         the cigarette or not?  

1905
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:20,572
 Uh, yeah...of course I did.    

1906
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:20,573
                       Yeah.    

1907
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:20,574
 I snagged these matches, too.  
 I think our guy                
 likes to go to Club Ekko.      

1908
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:20,575
                 Really?        
    Yes, really.                

1909
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:20,576
 Let's find out, shall we?      

1910
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:20,577
 Hang on.                       
 The couch was disgusting.      
 I need to wash my hands.       

1911
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:20,578
           Wait a minute,       
           you do live here?    

1912
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:20,579
 That's what I said.            

1913
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:20,580
                  Oh.           

1914
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:20,581
        Wow, your windows       
        are all boarded up.     

1915
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:20,582
     Yeah, I've got the glass,  

1916
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:20,583
    I just don't have the...    
    you know, window blankets.  

1917
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:20,584
  The curtains?                 
  You mean the curtains?        

1918
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:20,585
             Whatever. Okay?    

1919
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:20,586
        That's just my family.  

1920
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:20,587
                ASHBURN: Oh.    

1921
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:20,588
             Yeah, it's sweet.  

1922
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:20,589
 You want something to eat?     

1923
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:20,590
     I didn't finish my         
     submarine sandwich         
     the other day.             

1924
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:20,591
               No, thank you.   

1925
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:20,592
        Sorry I don't have      
        poached eggs in rubies  
        for you.                

1926
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:20,593
            No, I don't mean    
            to be rude, but...  

1927
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:20,594
          ...one could catch    
          a MRSA infection      
          in here, that's all.  

1928
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:20,595
  What part of that             
  wasn't rude?                  

1929
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:20,596
 Just for your own well-being.  
 For example, that door.        

1930
00:51:20,597 --> 00:51:20,597
            That door has no    
            way of locking.     

1931
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:20,598
       Someone could            
       barge in at any moment.  
       It's not safe.           

1932
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:20,599
 No one's coming in here...     

1933
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:20,600
 ...because they know           
 I keep this fully stocked.     

1934
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:20,601
               Oh, my God.      

1935
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:20,602
       Yeah, I know.            

1936
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:20,603
              A Marlin 1894CB?  

1937
00:51:20,604 --> 00:51:20,604
           Is that an FN PS90?  

1938
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:20,605
            Yeah! Nice one.     

1939
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:20,606
 You have all of this           
 in your house?                 

1940
00:51:20,607 --> 00:51:20,607
           You didn't even      
           mention my baby.     

1941
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:20,608
        Look at this.           
 Oh!                            

1942
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:20,609
      My little pride and joy.  

1943
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:20,610
         This little beauty     
         could vaporize         
         an above-ground pool.  

1944
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:20,611
            If you didn't want  
            the pool anymore.   

1945
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:20,612
         No kidding.            
                  Pretty, huh?  

1946
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:20,613
    Yeah. How do you            
    refuse that sales pitch,    
    huh?                        

1947
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:20,614
  You don't.                    
  Unless you're an asshole.     

1948
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:20,615
   I haven't seen one of these  
   since World War II.          

1949
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:20,616
 No! God,                       
 that...occasionally ticks.     

1950
00:51:20,617 --> 00:51:20,617
 Put it back slowly.            
 Slowly!                        

1951
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:20,618
 Like half that speed.          

1952
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:20,619
 Half that speed!               

1953
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:20,620
 Stop shaking.                  
 Put your pinky down.           

1954
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:20,621
   I got it on eBay.            
   It was supposed to be        
   bigger and different.        

1955
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:20,622
   It doesn't matter.           

1956
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:20,623
      I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"  
      his ass, though.          

1957
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:20,624
 LEVY: All right, ladies.       

1958
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:20,625
 Here's the DNA results         
 from the book of matches       

1959
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:20,626
 and the cigarette butt         
 you got from Tatiana's.        

1960
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:20,627
 We pulled two sets of prints.  
 First one's a real nut job.    

1961
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:20,628
             Look at this.      
             Reckless driving,  
             assault, arson.    

1962
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:20,629
               Oh, God.         
            Ahem! Really?       

1963
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,630
  Who the fuck                  
  is this guy?                  
            He's my assistant.  

1964
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:20,631
          You know              
          I'm an agent, right?  
              Arson?            

1965
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:20,632
 It was a drug house!           
                 (WHISTLES)     

1966
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:20,633
 I really feel the need         
 to finish reading your files.  

1967
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:20,634
 I feel the need                
 for you to stay                
 out of my business             

1968
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:20,635
 so I don't punch

     I don't have to            
     use the bathroom!          

2073
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:20,740
 Did I ask about                
 your bathroom habits?          
 You are killing us out there.  

2074
00:51:20,741 --> 00:51:20,741
             You don't fit in!  
             Take off that      
             fucking jacket.    

2075
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:20,742
 This is a good jacket.         

2076
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:20,743
          You look like you're  
          gonna set up a table  

2077
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:20,744
           and do their taxes.  
           Take it off!         

2078
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:20,745
  This is ridiculous.           

2079
00:51:20,746 --> 00:51:20,746
           Your shitty jacket?  
           My God!              

2080
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:20,747
 Okay, jacket's off.            
 Jacket's off.                  

2081
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:20,748
           I can't watch        
           whatever process     
           is about to happen.  

2082
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:20,749
               Now unbutton     
               your buttons.    

2083
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:20,750
  I'm a federal agent!          

2084
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:20,751
               I know, and you  
               look like one.   

2085
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:20,752
You think you'll bump into him  
and he won't                    
think something's up?           

2086
00:51:20,753 --> 00:51:20,753
    Fine. How's that?           
    Is that good?               
    Can we go?                  

2087
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:20,754
           No, I think          
           it's getting worse.  

2088
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:20,755
          My fear is I'm gonna  
          put you in a bikini   

2089
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:20,756
    and you'll still look like  
    a fucking bank teller.      

2090
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:20,757
     Do you have to             
     use that language?         

2091
00:51:20,758 --> 00:51:20,758
                 I'm trying to  
                 make a point!  

2092
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:20,759
        I'm saying your face    

2093
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:20,760
         and whatever is        
         underneath this        

2094
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:20,761
         shitty outfit is       
         maybe not terrible.    

2095
00:51:20,762 --> 00:51:20,762
 I'll have you know I           
 dress appropriately.           

2096
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:20,763
             I got it!          
             It's when this...  

2097
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:20,764
   ...your big flapping mouth,  
   starts running,              
   and then you put...          

2098
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:20,765
       ...this getup on top     
       of it, and it's just...  
       it's a boner killer.     

2099
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:20,766
           I'm gonna help you.  
   What are you doing?          

2100
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:20,767
           Now I just want      
           you to shut up.      

2101
00:51:20,768 --> 00:51:20,768
 (SIGHING) Oh, my God.          

2102
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:20,769
    Oh, my God!                 
    I only brought five         
    of these to Boston!         

2103
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:20,770
      I'll cut the other four.  

2104
00:51:20,771 --> 00:51:20,771
            God, that's         
            terrible fabric!    

2105
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:20,772
              Just get that     
              off your wrist.   

2106
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:20,773
   This one was of              
   my favorite ones.            

2107
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:20,774
             Just take it off.  
             Take it off!       

2108
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:20,775
    Okay, just give me          
    a second!                   

2109
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:20,776
  Okay, I look like             
  I've been attacked.           

2110
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:20,777
       That's not my fault.     

2111
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:20,778
 Oh, it's my fault?             
          Let me even out       
          the bottom.           

2112
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:20,779
 Would you stop                 
 carving up my clothes?         

2113
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:20,780
       I'm making shorts!       
       Everybody likes shorts.  

2114
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:20,781
    (SIGHING)                   
        Jesus! Hold still!      

2115
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:20,782
 That feels...awkward. Weird.   
 Don't touch that area.         

2116
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:20,783
        Don't duck down,        
        or you're gonna         
        suck my hand up there.  

2117
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:20,784
 Will you stop                  
 pulling my pants off?          

2118
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:20,785
                    Jesus!      
     What?                      

2119
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:20,786
              What are those?   

2120
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:20,787
               What are those?  
        Stop it!                

2121
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:20,788
 They're my Spanx.              
 They hold everything           
 together.                      

2122
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:20,789
             Why? What's gonna  
             come popping out?  

2123
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,790
 Nothing!                       
 It just keeps everything       
 where it's supposed to be.     

2124
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:20,791
         Shit, like medically?  

2125
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:20,792
 No, not medically.             
 Just to...                     

2126
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:20,793
  It just keeps it              
  right where it's              
  supposed to be.               

2127
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:20,794
            You got to vent     
            that furnace.       

2128
00:51:20,795 --> 00:51:20,795
         That's a lot of        
         compression and heat.  

2129
00:51:20,796 --> 00:51:20,796
     It gets plenty             
     of ventilation,            
     thank you.                 

2130
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:20,797
          My hand's a foot off  
          and it's on fire.     

2131
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:20,798
   Then why don't you           
   cut them shorter             

2132
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:20,799
  because no one can            
  see my cervix yet?            

2133
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:20,800
        I'll cut them shorter.  
 No, stop it!                   
 We're finished.                

2134
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:20,801
 Okay, let's do you now.        

2135
00:51:20,802 --> 00:51:20,802
            I don't need that!  

2136
00:51:20,803 --> 00:51:20,803
  What do you mean?             

2137
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:20,804
           I put my sexuality   
           out through motion.  

2138
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:20,805
       When this starts going,  
       it's all...              
       You'll get it.           

2139
00:51:20,806 --> 00:51:20,806
 So I have to look              
 like this and you              
 get to look like that?         

2140
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:20,807
      I know, it's not fair.    

2141
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:20,808
      (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)      

2142
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:20,809
         Hit it!                

2143
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:20,810
 What are you looking at?       

2144
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:20,811
    I like how your             
    friend's shorts             
    make me feel in my shorts.  

2145
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:20,812
       I am sorry.              
       That was much cruder     
       than I meant it to be.   

2146
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:20,813
             I stand corrected  
             on the shorts.     
             Let's proceed.     

2147
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:20,814
       Oh, God, we're dead.     

2148
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:20,815
      ASHBURN: At one o'clock.  

2149
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:20,816
    MULLINS: Let's do this.     

2150
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:20,817
        All right.              

2151
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:20,818
 Get in there.                  
 Get in there.                  

2152
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:20,819
      How do you get in?        
      I don't know how.         

2153
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:20,820
 Back it in.                    

2154
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:20,821
 Get in there.                  
 Get your hands in              
 and get the phone.             

2155
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:20,822
    Okay, Pinky.                

2156
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:20,823
 Do the cop drop.               
            I'm trying to!      

2157
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:20,824
 Do the fucking cop drop!       

2158
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:20,825
           I can't do it        
           from this position!  

2159
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:20,826
    No. No, no, no!             

2160
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:20,827
       Okay, coming in          
       one more time.           
       Get her away.            

2161
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:20,828
 MULLINS: I got her!            
 But you're like                
 a fucking nanny!               

2162
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:20,829
         Picture time!          

2163
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:20,830
                 Damn it.       
                 Can somebody   
                 get my phone?  

2164
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:20,831
 ASHBURN: I got it!             
 I got it! Let go!              

2165
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:20,832

   And close a couple           
   buttons...club policy.

2167
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:20,834
               MULLINS: I got   
               the orange one!  

2168
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:20,835
 I need some water.             

2169
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:20,836
             Stop it! Stop it!  

2170
00:51:20,837 --> 00:51:20,837
  I will fucking kill you.      

2171
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:20,838
           Where is he?         

2172
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:20,839
                Get in there.   
        Okay, one more time.    

2173
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:20,840
            Get her away.       

2174
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:20,841
     MULLINS: Jesus,            
     there's too many of them!

        LeSOIRE: Hello.         
            ASHBURN: Hi.        

2176
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:20,843
      Your moves are weird      
      as shit...and I love it.  

2177
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:20,844

    all due respect             
    with you people...          

2288
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:20,955
   ...is that you               
   get all excited,             
   your emotions take over...   

2289
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:20,956

    you're riding               
    the cotton pony...

    you're complimenting        

2291

       his fucking couch!

   who's your wife?

      We've been cramped        
      inside this van           
      for two months.

00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:20,963
       We're not gonna          
       let you swoop in         

2297
00:51:20,964 --> 00:51:20,964
      from nowhere and          
      take all the credit.      

2298
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:20,965
  I don't want to see you two   
  anywhere near this case!      

2299

      surveillance everywhere!  

2301
00:51:20,968 --> 00:51:20,968
             We do not need     
             the two of you...  

2302

      with your estrogen        
      flying at full speed...

 ...sticking out in the middle  
 of broad daylight              
 fucking things up for us!      

2304
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:20,971
     Because the two of us      
     are gonna bring            
     these guys in.

   That's right, keep walking.

       with hair on our legs.

00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:20,977
 You don't have to stop.        

2311
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:20,978
     What are you doing? Whoa!

 (SLAMS DOOR SHUT)              

2314
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:20,981
    You want to tell me         
    what was wrong back there?  

2315
00:51:20,982 --> 00:51:20,982
      Nothing.                  

2316
00:51:20,983 --> 00:51:20,983
      I saw your face when      
      you watched the footage.  

2317
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:20,984
        It looked like you      
        saw someone you knew.   
        Possibly your brother?  

2318
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:20,985
 You did not read that          
 from my fucking face.          

2319
00:51:20,986 --> 00:51:20,986
 You read my file,              
 didn't you?                    
 God, you're an asshole!        

2320
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:20,987
              Yes, I read it,   
              but it is my job  

2321
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:20,988
            to know everything  
            about a case,       

2322

    including who I work with.  

2323

  I don't like that.            

2324
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:20,991
              We should talk

2327
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:20,994
          Well then...let's     
          go to your parents'.  

2328
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:20,995
 No, I can't go                 
 to my parents'.                

2329
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:20,996
                    Why?        

2330
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:20,997
   I'm the one that             
   put him in jail.             

2331
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:20,998
             Okay, never mind.  

2332
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:20,999
  It's not like I               
  liked doing it.               

2333
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,000
  He got mixed up               
  with a lot of                 
  really bad people.            

2334
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:21,001
 And then he started...         

2335
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:21,002
 He started using that shit.    
 I just had to get              
 him out of there.              

2336
00:51:21,003 --> 00:51:21,003
         You know, ironically,  
         a lot of people        
         become addicted...

         wasn't finished.       
         I was going to say...

2345
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:14,162
       These are cloth.         
       They're nice.            

2346

Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like  
someone invading your privacy?  

2348
00:52:18,818 --> 00:52:23,638
       Oh, come on.             
       I glanced at your file.  
       You broke into my home!  

2349
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,774
      I care about who          
      I'm working with, too.    

2350
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,892
       And it's a little        
       uncomfortable            

2351
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,095
    that you feel the need      
    to travel with trophies.

      It's not what you think.  

2353

        rented this apartment,

                     Yes.       

2357
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:44,443
       Oh, God. I don't think   
       that could be            
       any sadder if you...     

2358
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:46,011
         ...threw it all        
         in the trash bag       

2359
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,280
       and started              
       dragging it behind you.  

2360
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:51,032
        You use coffee filters  
        for toilet paper        
        at your house.          

2361
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,351
    I'm buying them anyway.     
    They have a dual purpose.   

2362

             That's not         
             what they're for.

   I see it. I see it in here.  

2364
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,242
          Looks like you        
          were pretty cool      
          in high school, huh?  

2365
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,995
              Yes. Yes, I was.  
              But what...       

2366
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:04,729
      Because you weren't.      

2367
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,015
     You know what              
     that girl's not?           
     That girl's not cool.      

2368

       is you only have         
       two signatures...

    "Have a good summer."       
    That's a personal touch.    

2371
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,325
        My real favorite        
        is this one.            

2372
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,212
         "It'll get better."    

2373
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,813
             Yes, fine.         

2374
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:23,982
       Okay, now we're even.    

2375
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,900
                Okay.           

2376
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,386
      I see you have a cat.     

2377
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:30,522
                   Yep.         

2378
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,726
  Is he around?                 
  Because I'd like to,          
  you know, pet him and stuff.  

2379
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,279
       He...ran away, uh,       
       when I was in New York.  

2380
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:40,766
             (EXHALES)          

2381
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,504
         Oh, God, that          
         kind of tears me up.   

2382
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:48,507
           Yeah, it was,        
           um...it was a loss.  

2383
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:50,976
       That cat got one look    
       at your shitty life      

2384
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:53,411
    and said,                   
    "No fucking thanks, man...  

2385

      "...I am outta here!"     

2386
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,485
        I'm still kind of       
        just grieving           
        a little bit about it.  

2387
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:03,822
         That fucking tabby     
         is an asshole,         
         that's what he is.     

2388
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:05,423
              Fuck you!         

2389
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:09,394
      Yeah, "Fuck you!"         
      That's what I say         
      to that cat. Goddamn it.  

2390
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,252
       Such a shitty,           
       shitty little life.      

2391
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,270
    You can't even keep a cat.  

2392
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,022
              (THUMPING)        
      That hurts a little bit.  

2393
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,425
        That's just the grief.  
          No, not the grief.    

2394
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,344
              It's just         
              the pounding      
              a little bit.     

2395
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,379

          Why are you here?     

2507
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:03,002
  I'm a federal agent.          
  I'm a Special Agent.          

2508
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,738
       Special, like retarded?  

2509
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,007
  We don't use that word.       
  We say "special needs".

       That's a fair question.

 That's unusually               
 civilized for them.            

2524
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,287
         Oh, they cut out       
         his tongue, too.       
       Ah.

 There you have it.             
 They like to                   
 send a message.                

2526
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,025
 Did you find                   
 the tongue?                    
                Sure.           

2527
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:43,961
          Shoved it up          
          his anal cavity.      

2528
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:45,796
       That's a weird message.  

2529
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:47,965
       The tip of the tongue    
       was sticking             
       out of the rectum.       

2530
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:49,700
       So it made it appear     
       as if his buttocks       

2531
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:51,568
      were giving the police    
      the raspberry.            

2532
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,421
       Did they draw            
       googly eyes or anything  
       on his butt cheeks?      

2533

   an opportunity missed.       
   That would have been funny.

        anything on him         

2541

                 Is that coke?  

2543
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,375
 I don't think so.              
 It's more like a coating.      

2544
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:33,810

    on all the victims' shoes.

 Epoxy powder coating.

      Right?                    

2547
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,666
             That's right.      

2548
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:41,818
       Each sample was made     
       of the same ingredient.  
       Which means...           

2549
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:43,087

2568
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:20,824

        (MUTTERS SOFTLY)        
        Oh. This is

 but as a rule

2572
01:01:28,134 --> 01:01:30,851
         I was wondering if     
         you would not talk     
         to me in that tone.    

2573
01:01:31,403 --> 01:01:33,670
      Oh! Yes, of course!

01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:35,755
 That's a little different.     

2575
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:37,090
      I wouldn't.               
      Why would I?              

2576
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:39,025
   Why would you? Really.       

2577
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:40,778
    We should go to             
    the paint factory.          

2578

 Because it got                 
 real awkward.

 Thank you.                     
        I'm not gonna           
        shoot you.              

2609
01:03:05,797 --> 01:03:07,931
      Okay.                     
      It's cool, man.           
      Thanks.                   

2610
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,734
    He is.                      
        Wait! Hold on!          

2611
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:12,135
                      (SIGHS)   
     (WHISPERING) Shit!         

2612
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,771
      (WHISPERING)              
      If we grab Julian,        
      I can get into his head.  

2613
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,373
             We'll have Larkin  
             by tonight.        

2614
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,690
 Two against two.               
 I like those odds.             

2615
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,259
         I'll call for backup.  

2616
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,827
            (WHISPERING)        
            It's already here.  

2617
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:23,596
                 Oh, hey!       

2618
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,950
        I was looking for you.  
        Um, I forgot to         
        get your number.        

2619
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:31,055
  Cool. It's, uh,               
  1-800-GiveMeYourFuckingGuns.  

2620
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:34,858
             That's, uh...      
             too many numbers.  

2621
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,928
      I met these disasters     
      at the club               
      the other night.          

2622
01:03:38,997 --> 01:03:40,714
    Now they're both here.      

2623
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,215
       You think you            
       might have been bugged?  

2624
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,217
        Give me a break.        

2625
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,305
        What the fuck?          

2626
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,344
      Think you're hot shit?    
      Guess what.               

2627
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,346
    You guys look even          
    older in this lighting!     

2628
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,997
         Come on.               
        Fuck you.               

2629
01:03:58,066 --> 01:04:01,368
 Fuck you!                      
 It's not fuck me.              
 It's fuck you.                 

2630
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,788
 You know why?                  
 Because I'm about to           
 fuck you up.                   

2631
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,376
        Pick it up.             

2632
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:13,530
 Do it.                         
 Give me a reason to            
 shoot you in the face.         

2633
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:20,137
          How long              
          will this take?       

2634
01:04:20,205 --> 01:04:21,855
 Maybe 12 hours,                
 hopefully less.                

2635
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,557
 I have to find out             
 what drives him.               

2636
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,525
        We could just beat him  
        with a phonebook.       

2637
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,444
     No! For so many            
     reasons, no.               

2638
01:04:27,513 --> 01:04:28,912
        You just need           
        to be patient,          
        all right?              

2639
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:32,382
      It is crucial that        
      you remain patient.       

2640
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,952
        It's also crucial that  
        you stop wearing        
        this stupid barrette.   

2641
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,653
         Don't! Just leave it.  

2642
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:38,755
 Why?                           
 You have one                   
 on your head.                  

2643
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:40,857
      Yeah, on top of my head,  
      like a normal person.     

2644
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:43,093
 What is the difference?        
             Just move on.      

2645
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:45,912
 If you enter that room,        
 you could break                
 the bond we have created.      

2646
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,765
 Okay? Just please,             
 please trust me                
 on this one.                   

2647
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,516
 Do you understand              
 how important this is?         

2648
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,203
                Yeah, I do.     

2649
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:54,888
 And you will be patient?       

2650
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,606
                  I will.       

2651
01:04:57,409 --> 01:04:58,908
       Okay. All right.         

2652
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,398
   Hello.                       

2653
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:07,017
         Coffee?                

2654
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:09,686
 I drink a little more coffee   
 than I probably should.        

2655
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,238
 Where's Larkin?                

2656
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:14,524
       You couldn't wait        
       ten seconds?             

2657
01:05:14,593 --> 01:05:15,692
 What's so funny?               

2658
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:17,894
        You...                  
        thinking you're         
        going to make me talk.  

2659
01:05:17,963 --> 01:05:20,080
 You're talking                 
 right now, dumbass!            

2660
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:21,865
      You look like one of      
      the Campbell's soup kids  

2661
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,834
          who grew up and       
          became an alcoholic.  

2662
01:05:23,902 --> 01:05:27,171
 Oh, surprisingly catty.        
 You're a fucking genius.       

2663
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,540
 (WHISPERING) I asked           
 you to stay outside!           

2664
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,807
      (WHISPERING) I need to    
      go tough on him.
